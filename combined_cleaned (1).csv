His work in maharaja was so good that I literally yelled at him after every scene,The scene where he spits in the spitoon and offers it as prasad is so disgusting yet so alive
His screentime in Raazi was small yet left a lasting impression....,Same goes for Gangs of Wasseypur 1
He was amazing in An action Hero as well.,That was HIS movie. Ayushman was the side actor.
I wish he gets more and more roles and gets more commercial and critical success and loads of money,I will be very happy if it happens. Though I'm very glad after knowing he received 20 Crores for Paatal Lok season 2 after a mere 40 Lacs for season 1.\nHope he gets many more amazing projects in future from mainstream bollywood and earns huge as well.
He was so good in Action Hero too !,Hum sab chutiye hai jo tujhe maarna chahte hai
For me his best work is still GoW,This. Those opening 15 min of GOW 1 were up there with the greatest shots of Indian cinema.
"From his powerful performances to his sheer dedication to the craft, Jaideep has proven time and again that he is one of the finest actors of our generation. Whether it's his role in *Paatal Lok*, where he brought the complex character of Hathi Ram Chaudhary to life, or his other impactful performances across films and shows, Jaideep’s versatility is unmatched.",AI .. AI .. everywhere..
"His acting is top notch. Only that interview he gave, on shopping, has rubbed  people the wrong way.",what was that huh?
Dr. Asthana in Munna Bhai : Why would a father want his daughter to marry someone considered a criminal? Helping some patients doesn’t justify his insufficient impact on the medical field.,There was no villain ever in Raju Hirani movies.
"I don't think Chatur was fundamentally wrong neither I can say he was right. He did what he thought would bear him the success. Similarly, all 3 Idiots took risks and they too were successful.","Chatur is one of the ""you missed the point by idolizing him character"""
Raghav in Chain Khuli ki Main Khuli,He was just a child too😭😭😠
 Abhishek Bachchan in Raavan.,Everyone agrees Dev is the real villian.
Suhas from 3 idiots,Ikr 😆\n\nI would be pissed too if someone put chutney on my dedh lakh ke joote
"Unfortunately the crux of the story has not been assimilated. \n\nKabil bano, success ke peeche mat bhaago…","Kabil bano, success ke peeche mat bhaago…\n\nvery good msg, but practically this doesn't work in 3rd world countries like ours where 0.1% ppl have taken the majority resources, and so there are very limited resources left and unlimited ppl fighting for them"
"Jim in Pathaan? His actions obviously weren't right at all. But the cause that led him to go rogue was surely worth considering. It even got Pathaan himself questioning the system, saying how if it was some politician's family's life at stake, we would've done anything to save them.",Sadly that was the peak of Pahtaan to me. It was all just mindless action otherwise. I really wanted that to go somewhere.
With age I am siding more with Chatur than Rancho,"That’s how life is, I don’t think people who are privileged enough actually gets the time to become “Kabil” and rather they have to run behind success to prove a point."
"I remember when I was just a trainee at a company and one of my colleagues who was an engineer had plans to go for an MBA.\n\nShe was telling me about her plans but also was a bit embarrassed. 3 idiots had just some out and she thought she was following in the footsteps of Suhas. Rancho makes fun of Suhas for pursuing an engineering degree and then going for MBA and working for a bank.\n\nMan was I irritated at that message when I was watching the film. But when I saw that it actually impacted people and shamed them for doing this, I was annoyed even more.\n\nYou can choose whatever path you want. You have the right to change your mind regarding what you want to do in your life. Not everyone is born knowing what they want to do, what their passion is. A lot of people don’t even figure out what their passion is until very late in their life. Are they supposed to just wait around and do nothing until then? \n\nYou can spend years being an engineer, a good one at that and realize when you are 50 that your real passion lies in say cooking or social work or commerce. You can change gears then if you want to and not pay heed to anyone shaming you by saying stuff like “agar bank mein naukari karni thi to engineering kyo kiya”. \n\nMany people find their passion but realize that the thing they are passionate about will not help them put food on the table. It’s okay to not pursue it as your full time job if you are not financially secure. Everyone’s life is different and if you are doing honest work and not harming anyone, don’t be ashamed of “not being able to follow your passion”.","Changing mind is good. But most people aren't going ""MBA is my passion. Engineering isn't"". Why are you doing Engineering if you want to do MBA in the future. Do BBA.\n\nThe message wasn't for people who change their minds about what they are passionate about. The message was for people who follow a plan like a sheep. \n\n>  “agar bank mein naukari karni thi to engineering kyo kiya”.\n\nThat's a legitimate question if you are choosing engineering while planning to do non-engineering jobs. If the trainee wanted to be an engineer but later found MBA more interesting, that's a different scenario."
I don't think he was a villain really. Just a petty guy who held a grudge for a long time.,"He was desperate to make a career. His family was from Uganda, if you look up the persecution of Indian migrants in Uganda under Idi Amin's rule you will understand why financial stability was crucial for him and he couldn't have done engineering ""for fun""."
What the fck this is actually too similar I laughed for a good minute 🤣,It's rare to see itachi laughing. Am I under genjutsu?
Dhamaal will always be my favourite in comedy genre,Yes Dhamaal was a gem
"Fuck, this is a brilliant post. Something rare for the type. Hope it gets reach",If it gets big it'll be a W for op
,"Wow Adi, you're so smart"
Dhamaal has sanjay dutt and mid game has TOP,Munna bhai vs Fantastic baby
"I honestly don’t know whether Bollywood had this dreamy, unique charm back then that’s missing, or if that’s just childhood nostalgia talking.","I think it did, but the same was for all entertainment industries in general. Social media wasn’t a thing back then, so celebrities had an air of mystery around them since we weren’t so overexposed to them. We had to soak up every bit of trivia we could in much-awaited magazine articles & scheduled interviews. \n\nI still miss it, though."
"Hrithik, saif, shahid aged like the finest winw",Why tf is ashutosh rana in this randomly
I'll forever be jealous of 90's kids because of how many iconic stars they saw grow as time went on. Bollywood used to have a charm back then.,"Late 80’s and early 90’s kids actually witnessed a lot of big changes, be it in demographics, geography, history, science, technology or even culture & entertainment. They were at the threshold of every change."
I still remember the day Kahi Na Pyar Hai came and the instant national heartthrob that hritik became. It was next level. \n\nI was the biggest fan of Akshay Kumar when he used to do Khiladi series. Khiladiyo ka khiladi was such a massive hit for me since it had  the WWF stars in it. \n\nSalman didn't have a lot of pull but for the girls and amir was also decent but Shahrukh was next level literally the king of Bollywood.,Salman and aamir def had a lot pull. No idea what you’re talking about.  Most girls were Gaga first for Salman and srk was second.
"Same could be said for Akshay Kumar. You know him from Phir Hera Pheri. OGs know him from Khiladi, which came out 14 years prior.",For real. This sub’s obsession with Phir Hera Pheri astounds me.
Salman tho! His swag and screen presence is unmatched.,I was thinking the same.
old is seriously gold. unmatched standards and an unmatched time.,When you realise your parents can use Amitabh in a similar video\nFrom\nTheir times too
Lol why did you choose Koyla for SRK,It's actually Karan Arjun 😅
Did you just use Agneepath to show Amitabh in his prime?\n He was around 50 yrs old then,I agree with you but technically it's right. This is from 90s POV and at that time AB was doing Agneepath.
AB playing old man roles >>>> AB as angry young man,I concur. AB has always been the wise old man for our generation since childhood so the angry young man roles our parents get nostalgic about don’t really make us feel the same way.
Okay won't lie..\n This was a brilliant catch,100 baar movie dekhi hai but pehle kabhi notice hi nahi kiya!!
That's why this movie cult classic. Never noticed it even after watching it 287...times.,Yess!! Part 2 and 3 will never stand in front of this masterpiece!!
"I dont think he saw her face. It was dark over there and maybe her face was covered by her hair, so he must have seen her silhouette.","yes, but maybe she didn't think of that. cuz she did see him, and wasn't so sure if he knew or not..."
It’s true I saw her,Ab to chhote pandit ne khud bol diya!! Ab to confirm ho gya!!🙌🏼🙌🏼
"But when she is her normal self she doesn't even know that she is Monjulika. She doesn't then remember the things that she does, sees as Monjulika.",Tabhi to vo is gaane pe shridhar k sath naachi thi!!
RE RELEASE PLS,"Part 2, 3 nikalne ki jgh yhi vaps dikha do"
Watch the original man! There’s even more rewatch value in it,Not for people outside kerala. Both films are tailor made for a different set of audience.
Kuthiravattom pappu,"It's said that Dr Sunny didn't ""cure"" Pappu's character coz he saw Ganga (Nagavalli)"
![gif](giphy|Lcn0yF1RcLANG|downsized),This was my reaction!!😂
"Well done, amazing catch and amazing movie editing by the makers to keep the narration on point. 👌",Aur humko ye catch karne mein itne saal lag gaye!!
"Fun fact after a few years of this movie's release I went to Satyajit Ray film academy (not to study, but for something else) and got to have a talk with Amol Gupte.\n\nHe loved talking movies and stuff and that evening he talked about how Aamir Khan took away the credit for directing Taare Zameen Par. He was so pissed I was just shocked.\n\nThen when I started my career in movies a while ago, I was given a list of people by someone saying never ever narrate your full story for them without some kind of contract or be ready to get it stolen, Aamir Khan's name was among those people.",Amir Khan did hogg all the credits. It's the truth.\nTare zameen par was Amol's brain child.
"Everytime this movie would come up, I was so afraid as a kid that my parents would send me to a hostel far away from them. ""Kya itna bura hu mai maa"" still haunts me to this day.","Those who can relate. I sympathize and empathize with all those who had learning disabilities, autism and other neurodivergents growing up in the 70s-90s. More power to you. Be your best selves. You are wonderful people."
"Fun fact- This actor had never cried in his real life before this scene, Aamir khan taught him breathing techniques in this crying scene to make it look real.",Not even when he was born.\n\n![gif](giphy|13TSd5PzuGpmGA)
"Guys love from tamilnadu , this is my first bollywood movie we were actually telecasted this movie in school  taare zameen par , dang we cried a lot during that ma song  didnt know the language both hindi and english back then so subtitles too didnt help but the thing is but were able to understand the movie just thro the emotions and brilliant acting , that last scene where they conduct an art competition was inspired by our principal and she initiated a competition where anyone can express their talent on a sunday morning but it only happened once but the effect of this movie is unmatched \n\nW! movie bollywood wish we get more films like this , i loved movies like this ,chennai express ( tho it basically potrayed us south in a very sterotypical way the movie was fun gotto give that ! the movie was a banger) , Happy new year , dangal  \n\nAs a movie lover I wish I get to explore some classics like this from any industry for that matter so feel free to suggest a few good movies","Sparsh(1980), Naya Daur(1957), Satya(1998) and many more.."
Omg my life was so beautiful when I saw this movie ... Nothing was going on in my life but there was so much potential.,Well now there’s lots of stuff going on and you STILL have potential. That’s a beautiful life too.
"I remember listening to this line  “kya itna bura hu mei maa?” while sitting alone in dormitory of my boarding school. \n\nThose hard days are long gone but not forgotten, left me with many scars now.",What movie is this
American here. What is happening to the boy?,"Context: He is missing his mom while struggling at studies in a boarding school. \nIt's a really good movie, do watch it if you get a chance."
Don't worry they'll shut it just like the Indian version of friends and the office.,Didn't know we had indian version of office
Bs laurie na lg jaye iske,Meri trf se 🍾 battli award
Industry is truly creatively bankrupt. Only thing they can do is remake what's successful.,WTF?\n\n\nThere are plenty of series in Hollywood that are adapted by successful Korean & Nordic series.\n\n\nIndian OTT has lot of original shows which are wildly successful and probably a handful of remakes & if you can bring your own vision into it then there is nothing wrong in it.\n\n\nA House like character in an Indian govt hospital like setting if done well can be amazing entertainment.
"What made House the show it was, was the absurd comedy.\n\nIndian shows, for the most part, don't use a lot of adult humor because everyone will be offended by everything. House had a lot of humor that could've been ""offensive"" if not for Hugh's talented delivery. Siddiqui just does not have that kind of talent.",Yess... his sarcastic comments are not something that I feel can be remade in Hindi.
Iski zarurat nahi hai bilkul. Please for the love of God we already have one Night Manager we don't need another,Very rare but Indian night manager was actually good.
Noooo need,What's the need of ruining a perfectly good show? Plus there are a lot of things in the show that'll look terrible in the Indian context. We already have remakes of various shows that didn't work. Why not make something original?
"Unfortunately Nawaz plays Nawaz everytime, and whilst his most successful roles have required him to play similar characters, it restricts his range significantly.","With all due respect, have you seen the lunchbox?"
"in all my heart that goes out to nawaz, he just cannot play house - the eccentricity and intricacies of the role simply do not suit his genre\n\nhouse is based on sherlock, an inherently sociopathic genius who borderline breaks laws everyday, while that may seem like a role nawaz can pull off, it's simply too deep to pickup\n\nsome things arent meant to be copied - office maybe, but something like this?\n\ni feel like after the minor success of the night manager in which hugh laurie was played by anil kapoor, they thought to remake this too, and if they indianise it and ruin the essense of the show i will lose my mind (i love house to death)","Me too. Sherlock, Sopranos and House are my ATF shows. A flawed, damaged, and miserable genius - its such a convoluted yet brilliant character. Nawaz may be able to pull it off, maybe not but I hope he doesn't try to emulate Laurie completely as that's a guaranteed recipe for failure. \n\nIt will be equally interesting to see who plays Cuddy and Wilson as those 2 characters are equally important to the success of such a project. Shefali or Tisca would be great for Cuddy imo."
"If they really had to then irrfan khan would've been a good choice, now I'd say kay kay menon would be better than nawazuddin. He can pull that arrogant genius type attitude house was famous for.","Loved menon in shekhar home, he could definitely pull off house"
"Ive watched the original series, and acting in that is just top notch I hope Bollywood doesnt ruins it…",Dude... its bollywood... of fucking course theyre gonna ruin it
Respect is a two way street,Most Indian Uncles don't understand that
this and also 2states marriage wala scene,Is it available in YouTube? Never heard about 2 states deleted scene
This is one of the only scenes I know from the movie (haven’t seen it). You’re telling me this was cut?? It’s so good tho,Yeah it wasn't in the original cut of the film.
"Somebody needs to tell these boomers. Respect is not a birth right. it is not to be taken, it is to be earned.",So you generally insult everyone until you know them and earned your respect
To be honest alia bhatt is actually a best  ' nepo ' kid . I literally love this particular scene,she is the most prettiest amongst all actresses combined
"wtf, she can't act. uncle is acting great.",What are you on? She’s really good here.
Her acting is weird though,Acting is not weird. She is just uncomfortable and trying to be brave. I mean the character.
"Abhishek was completely overshadowed. First movie me toh tab bhi he has his moments as a parallel lead but in this one... body, looks, dance, acting, screen presence. He couldn't match up against the literal definition of ""Hero Material"" opposite him.",Exactly...poor guy felt like a supporting actor in his own franchise
"I have said this here before, I will say it again - if they make a Dhoom 4, I do not want the cop angle, instead, give me an Aryan vs Kabir movie.",Bruh...Dhoom multiverse will be amazing
"Dhoom was the most genre-oriented Hollywood-like film, Dhoom 2 had a balance between that and Bollywood masala, whereas Dhoom 3 went full masala mode. Would be so fun if Dhoom 4 was Aryan Vs. Kabir.",Dhoom 1 was a masterpiece. Dhoom 2 the first half robberies were fantastic to watch even it was more fantasy type the second half was boring and meanigless. Dhoom 3 just trash
"Can totally relate with Aish here. Two of the hottest, most good looking humans in one movie.",Who is the second?
and aish+hrithik is the best thing that happened.... especially the kiss,They looked fuming hot together
"When a beauty like Aishwarya rai gets mesmerised and falls for someone’s looks as can be seen in this scene, then you truly are a very very very handsome guy indeed ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed)",Bro...its a movie ...theres a script
"Imagine if YRF brings back this character of HR for a Dhoom installment maybe the antagonist of dhoom 4 is too smart to get caught so much so that just before interval Abhishek’s character has to go to HR to ask for help, the cops are thinking what to do and Abhishek says “sirf ek hai jo usse pakad ne mein hamari madad kar sakta hai” and then ali realises who he is talking about and says “lekin vo police ki madad kyu karega” and abhishek says “cause he owes me one(referencing to the fact that abhishek let him go)” and they cut to HR’s silhouette with his theme music playing and *INTERVAL*\n\nBro i would go for first day first show ngl",why are you giving us pipe dreams? :(((
"For films like war , dhoom there is no one better then hrithik . His charisma can make such avg films watchable",Looking forward to him as Kabir in the next YFR Spy universe movie for this exact reason. Will be nice seeing him as some what of a Villain depending on what YRF has planned for Kabir's character
John didn't fall for any honeytrap though,He fell for Ali mf
"Sorry, my vote goes to John Abraham. Ever man on street copying your hairstyle. Straight men pausing John Abraham’s screen time. My GOD i was shocked 😳. Nothing happened in Hrithik’s case. But Kaho Na pyaar hai definitely did that what John did in Dhoom","Came here to say exactly this. To me, John is the OG villain in Dhoom. Acted all natural and made his character look cool."
mf dropped the greatest Indian action scene edit casually.,Thanks man! This was my first time editing btw
Anirudh whenever fan edits are made:    \n*Aisi situation mein main aage kaise aajata hu?*\n\n\nLoved your edit btw!!!!,I love Anirudh’s music and this song from Vikram is fire imo! I’m glad you enjoyed this!
Repost it with your watermark or something bro! This is gonna get viral. Great edit bro!,Haha thanks man. I’ll put my watermark in the future videos
Kya bedi. Aisa aag lagaya ki fire department bhi bujha nahi payega. Police pakad lega re tereko itna mast tribute banaya re tum. Simply awesome mera bhai...,Arey thank you yaar so much for your kind words! 🙏🙏\n\n![gif](giphy|3ohfFy17ftFqlbvarS|downsized)
I love this edit this feels more professional that Vijay thallapathy's movies (he is an actor and doesnt edit but yea those go hard too). \nMy only request is to add a lil but more speed to these as sometimes slow mo doesnt feel right but this one is overall 9/10 (i rarely even give 8 for context),Really appreciate your advice! I’m glad you enjoyed it!
Wow impressive! Also this made me realize we need more female action movies,Thanks man and yeah we need more female action movies. I forgot to add Manikarnika :(
So good,Glad you enjoyed it!
Abe bsdk.\nItna accha edit ●o●\nYe le upvote\n\n\nP.S.  YT pr bhi daal sahi views aayenge,YouTube copyright de ga. Koi idea hai kaise dalu?
Incomplete without Gangs of Wasseypur,Gangs of Wasseypur is a great movie but I don’t think it’s an action genre film
Which are the movies ? Which is the first movie,The first movie is Animal

Cancer survivor and Marathi stage and movie legend. Wish more Marathi people get a fair shot at stardom in Bollywood.,"Bollywoodच्या लोकांना पंजाब्यांचाच उदोउदो करायचा आहे. आपली मराठी चित्रपटसृष्टी मजबूत करणे हाच एक उपाय आहे. Southकडे बघा, त्यांना Bollywood ची अजिबात फिकीर नाही कि गरज नाही. कारण त्यांचे नाणे खणखणीत आहे."
Idk why no movie today can write a story let alone a scene half as funny as this.,"Bcoz they have remaked all films from Malayalam.\nMost Hindi priyadarshan movies are Malayalam remakes including Hera pheri, bhool bulayya etc"
I was laughing so hard at this scene. Billu is an underrated film,Billu is a remake of katha parayumbol.. but this specific scene is lifted from another Malayalam movie called azhakiya ravanan
"Backstage : This scene's inspiration - Malayalam movie ""Azhakiya Ravanan"" (1996).",Priyadarshan does not remake a single Malayalam/Tamil film at a time. He also copies individual scenes from other Malayalam films and pastes them in the middle of another film's remake.
Thonakkal panchayathile oro ariyum njan perukki eduthu.,😆😅😂 macha polli. And the actors have done a good job in this scene remake as well
"I freaking love this SRK wayyyyyyyyyyyyy more than Jawan, Pathan and Dunki.",same here missing that era
Can someone tell me which movie this is??? I want to watch!,Billu Barber.\n\nThis scene is funny but overall the movie is a drama.
😂😂😂,This is just so funny af haha
this scene is good but they stretched it too much by repeating the same thing again and again,Nope ! It still looks funny.
"Don't know about the movie but the way he's explaining it, there's a sense of pride and happiness that only comes with honest work. Wish him success and prosperity.",It's a good movie on Netflix. Do give it a watch. Has also Priyanka in it.
He was also in My Name Is Khan for about 5 min. He played the teenaged Rizwan who removed water with a cycle,Oh yes! Now i recall
"Bro the movie was so fucking good, I've watched it like 4 times and I still cannot get enough of it. Brilliant actor.","If you like the movie so much I recommend reading the original novel it is based on (shares the same title as the movie in case you didn't know). A lot was cut from the novel and all that was cut adds even more to the story, ofc they cannot include everything in the movie so they kept the important stuff."
"Am confused. What does he mean by hidden cameras. How did they shoot the camera following him, if it was hidden. \n\nEven a dslr would be visible in such a shot when cameraman is so close.\n\nDid they just use a phone? But it doesn't have that handheld feel",>What does he mean by hidden cameras\n\nMostly GoPro now - while holding a GoPro you can easily blend with the crowd because now everyone is a vlogger and most of them own a GoPro. \n\n>dslr would be visible in such a shot when cameraman is so close.\n\nThey usually don't follow the subject. Those cameras are fixed on a person later they edit it.\n\n>just use a phone?\n\nYes they can use iPhone as it has better video recording quality.
So the pedestrian and the police didn’t see the cameraman and other film crew?,"Yeah, doesn’t make sense. Great acting no doubt, but everyone being unaware seems too far fetched."
You killed it as ‘Chota Ganchi’ also. Excited for the season 2,"Bro , i dm u  , dobreply atleast yes or no."
Button Nahi Dabana Tha from Dhamaal. The dude gives a hard hitting fact about Death while saving Boman's plane.,Haan to baman baman.
I’m back for one more that came to mind: the police station scene in Andaaz Apna Apna and the scenes of the interactions between Aamir Khan/Salman Khan and their respective Dads.,"It funniest when prem picks up a ringing telephone.\n\n""Hello ? Saab biji hai baad me phone karna, are comissioner hoga apne ghar ka hoga"""
Paresh Rawal and Sharat Saxena’s interactions in De Dana Dan 😂 - actually that entire movie had so many moments where my stomach was in pain from laughing.,It's my favourite movie. In 2010 on my way to Canada I watched it like 4 times and was laughing like a maniac. The hostess came 10 times to shush me down. Finally I slept laughing. I was 5.
"Golmaal scene, where principal comes to visit and Ajay Devgn dresses up as Paresh Rawal and acts blind, that was funny af.",I will never forget those slaps\n\nThat's what she said
Bollywood movies don't have logic,Basically every Indian movie
"No\nMatter how old i will be , this movie will always hit different 😭😭😭😭 they need to make more movies focusing on such important topics",Nowadays the movies made on social topics feels like propaganda for some reason like they simply lack the soul that these older movies had
Because nobody goes to watch such movies anymore. They want it on Ott,"This movie got attention because it was directed and acted by one of the Khans, and it was nice that the subject matter addressed was something important. Otherwise, it probably wouldn’t have done that good of business"
"We often talk about the star's debut but almost never about the character actors.\n\nVipin Sharma did a very good job in this movie.\n\nSimilarly, Rajesh Sharma in Khosla ka Ghosla and Manu Rishi, Manjot Singh in Oye lucky lucky oye were able to leave lasting impressions.",One good thing I found about foreign audience is that character actors are the charm in the West they go bonkers about whenever there is a discussion about them and their performances\n\nSadly such a culture is beyond the reach of our masses due to Hero worship culture since ages and especially in last 30 years it has took a negative turn and recently just emulating southern industries wrong trends (they have right things too just hindi industry is too naive to understand) is taking them in backward direction
"I hate the pan India movement and how it has turned Bollywood into a Hindi-ized Tollywood to try and compete with them because it took movies and moments like these away from us. Gone are the days mainstream Bollywood will make films like tzp, rdb, znmd, dch, haider, pk, etc. Bollywood is refusing to take risks anymore because of the beating it took in the box office to Tollywood in 2021 and 2022 and is now just copying them to compete. I mean almost all the top 10 Bollywood grossers of last year had so many elements copied from south action mass masalas and finally Bollywood was able to overtake Tollywood at the box office\n\nWe have traded emotional scenes like this for elevation scenes I fucking hate it","I am a Telugu guy and agree with this totally. Every top Telugu hero movie is now a pan India movie, getting released in 5-6 languages. Budgets are bloated but there is no proper script work done at all. To appeal to audience across the board, they rope in a Bollywood actress (it has been the case for the past 30 years anyway), bring in character artists and comedians from other languages (Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil). They then pack it with as much masala as possible to appeal to masses. Seems that they all cooked up a formula for these kind of movies. The resulting product is a weird amalgamation of content which does not feel native to any particular language or region or culture. The makers really don't give a fuck because the hype machine takes care of extracting huge openings and by the time audience realize the movie is crap, they recover 50-60% of the investment and rest on OTT and satellite rights. They also hoard up all the theaters in the 2 Telugu states and smaller movies do not even have a chance.\n\nAll of this is exasperated by OTT. The general consensus among makers is that the audience will not come to the theaters to watch small & medium budget movies. Not sure why they have that misguided conception or it might be because they are not confident of their product. I hate the current state of Tollywood. All good movies end up in OTT. There was a recent movie (35) which reminded me a lot of Tare Zameen Par. It was a simple story, realistic and very sensibly made. However, very few watched it in theaters."
this movie literally deserved oscar,"Yeh movie dekh ke nikla tha jab , Panwadi ko pakad ke roya tha , us din usne free cigarette diya tha."
They didn't back then either. This movie was the exception rather than the rule,Exactly! And these types are movies are also made nowadays. e.g. that moment of realisation when Vikrant Massey's character cracked the interview in 12th fail.
Actor name? Beautiful acting from him,Vipin Sharma (the father)
The sad thing is our society won't accept it,"I see so many parents with special kids walk around holding hand in hand, one of my Mom's friend's kid was special too. Its immensely difficult to understand how the parent feels especially to see the kids at their own kid's age perform and do well in life when their own kid is stuck. Her son was of my age I am earning today in an MNC and he was unable to even leave the house without their guidance. You can know how they must have felt. He died last year and his mom has never been the same. Parents of such kids have a whole different struggle which often goes unnoticed, we feel bad for the kids but fail to sympathize with those parents.\n\nSociety is changing, there is acceptance yes it isnt enough but there surely is change happening. So many parents are making efforts to understand their kids and their problems. \n\nThis film not only changed the kids who watched it but also parents. My own mother cried when she watched the film cause she was reminded of me tho mai toh normal hun but yes at times we need to think from a parent's point of view too."
What’s the context behind this scene? Been ages since I’ve seen this movie,"This scene tells lot about indian dads. After amir tells him what actually caring for children is there he realises how till now he has always misunderstood his son. This is the first time in the film he cries. But from the beginning of the film he is show as a serious man with responsibilities, tough, always stays firm, never backs out, which has made him so hard.\n\nHe is feeling so guilty that now he cant even go and talk with his son and therefore he leaves without meeting his son."
"He absolutely did.  I remember tons of people on this sub going gaga over him whenever a movie he's in was brought up.  Also he's worked with major actors like Salman, Tiger Shroff, multiple times, even got his hands in Hollywood with Extraction 2.  If he's not as popular as he should be now that's really just on him & his marketing team.",I see what you did there and mentioned Tiger Shroff as a major actor !!!!!
"Veer Savarkar and Main aur Charles, he did justice to the characters!\nBoth awesome biopics!",Mai aur charles was mid he could have done it better.
watch laal rang,Ab to YouTube me bhi available he 6 mahine me 1 baar dekh leta hu
It was unfortunate to see him in a disaster like Radhe,But salman hooda duo was good in sultan 🤡
Sorry but he is a casteist,You got any thing to back your claim?
"These details were shared by vinod Chopra the director of the movie in an interview, along with why he used steady cam, music choices and no make up, now these people will take every note from it and then put it as if they found these details",apparently VVC himself called the page and talked to the guy who made this. dont think he would’ve called if it was copied from his interview
I went to see this movie in theatre.. but the hall was half empty.. it should have been given more credit months ago when it released.. seems unfair,"True, people don't spend money on such movies and only appreciate when they arrive on OTT.."
"Just watched it, what a masterpiece!! I was not expecting it to be this damn good 👍🏾","Where to watch the movie, I don't have hotstar\n subscription"
Nah this movie is shit n boring. Can't match the magic of salar kgf jawan pathan etc all these osm movies we need more of those. \n🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡,"Nope, we need subtle rounded dramas like this too. It's very inspiring and grounded. It's on par with commercial movies and succeeds well above in terms of re-watch value and substance."
Vikrant Massey is an eyesore.,Most IAS officers aren't handsome. \n\nDo you seriously want Hritik or Sallu bhai to play the role of a upsc student?
unnecessary but ok,"Not really. I observed this in theatre, from Shraddha's humming when their relationship is growing, to the latter part of the movie when they've expressed each other where the humming transitions to instrumental. It really relates to the stage their relationship has reached, well at least I felt that."
I havent watched 12th fail yet but decided to watch this video and well i guess im a bit spoiled now huh,"except for the part where she confessed her love for him, youre good"
@ of the orginal creator please,"Yeah! Mention the creator, please!"
"I completely agree ,not just the quality of actors even directors have gone down and most of it is because of these good directors not giving enough shit about it. RGV, Karan, Anurag all have just disappeared",Kjo himself has gone down big time! He's now only focussed on making shitty money making stuff
"This isnt pure ""cinematography"" this is just transitions which the director chose , I think you meant pure cinema.\n\nAnyways non action and non lewd stuff is alive and well just step out of Bollywood and pan India non sense.","That's the problem, we want good quality non action stuff in bollywood too"
"Its not such good in terms of cinematography, the biggest artiste  here is the editor. What you are so excited about are the transitions and actors and directors direction.",It's not about transitions it's abt showcasing 4 characters in 4 different seasons.
As a director KJO is top tier….,Agreed mate. He gave 10 days to shoot this one song.
Karan Johar was amazing before he got obsessed with Alia.,Yesss. His obsession with SRK-Rani-Kajol phase gave us some of the best movies+ music albums.
It’s a copy of a Hollywood movie dawg not original,"Yeah but it has that Bollywood magic, and when you have these elite actors on screen, it goes from copy to improvement. \n\nAin’t no way Hollywood busting out to a dance sequence either with a catchy tune."
Wait until someone finds out it's copied from some hollywood movie,But there is a sense of originality about it you can't deny. \nMust have been inspired but Hollywood wouldn't spend 10 days filming a song travelling to three different states while on a tight budget.
what movie is this?,kabhi alvida naa kehna
"This isn't cinematography at all its more of an editor-director work and tbh there are so many different movies across languages and genres that have explored this same editing trick. \n\nIf you are trying to show bollywood was once great and now it's just bad then stop using KJO movies as an example, his movies were always shit",How Ridiculous and lewd comment is this.
This isn’t as special as you think. It’s just basic cinematography. Also very on the nose and not subtle at all.,"What a Ridiculous thing to say? \nThe scene comes across as so beautiful even if it's basic cinematography,how does it matter?\nKaam ho gya na? Dekh k acha laga na? \n\nAnd everything doesn't have to be subtle."
 is scene ke bare me kuch bataiye please.,He didn't get credited for this role. His name is mentioned nowhere.
"Sir was there a script you didn't like before, but you changed your mind?","Yes, that film was Mimi. And I got a National Award for the same film. Ab lagta hai ki chhod deta toh malaal hota."
who would you like to dance with in a movie,"Kriti Sanon, humari Mimi."
Kaaleen Bhaiya ko mera Namaskaar 🙏 Love to see you here.\n\nSimplicity is the hardest thing to do but looking at you it seems not so hard for you. What is the secret?  Aren't you attracted to the glimmer?,"Khush raho. Iska secret yeh hai ki oxygen sab ek hi lete hai, oxygen abhi tak glamour aur glitter ka mishran nahin ban hai."
What makes this role special for you,"Bahot special hai kyun ki, it's not a fictional character. Ek real aur legendary personality ko recreate karna tha. Atal Ji mere bhi favourite politician aur poet the."
what is your process of script selection? and are you still required to audition for certain roles?,"No auditions, only look-tests. Aur jo content/script dil ko accha lag jaye."
What kind of role do you think will be completely out of your comfort zone?,Playing the role of my opposite gender.
When and what was your first ever experience of the art of acting? And how did you feel?,"During my childhood, mere gaon ke Chhat festival mein ek play hua tha jahan I played a female character. Kaafi nervous tha main."
"Sir, how are you? Is their any unknown project you are really excited about? Can you share us a little bit about it?","3-4 mahine ki chutti lene wala hoon. Kisi ko batana mat. Actually, I am planning to do theatre."
"Sir, we've seen you do so many diverse roles in so many movies. Hats off to you because you're a great actor as well a great person.\nMy question to you is if you had to describe your acting career and your whole journey in just a sentence, what would it be?",It’s like a river journey. Nadi ki yatra.
"playing politician is most difficult of all acc to me,they potray wide variety of emotion and speeches with seriousness on their face.currently i only see manoj vajpayee capable after watching him in aligarh","I think he just failed to get into the character here. He had to mostly copy Vajpayee here, but he tried to give an award winning performance.\n\nLook at how he’s moving his eyebrows, he had be more settled there. \n\nHe needed to first get into the situation - settle his emotions - it is a mix of anger, frustration, disappointment, and determination. Vajpayee had that on his face! He wasn’t performing, he seemed quite genuine about it.\n\nFlaws from my pov:\n\n1.	⁠He shouldn’t be wearing glasses. Misses the emotion he could have expressed with his eyes.\n2.	⁠Pankaj is speaking to the speaker instead of the MPs in the house. Vajpayee wasn’t talking to the speaker, he was talking to the MPs and delivering message to the MPs. The camera angle didn’t help either\n3.	⁠It wasn’t about Sonia Gandhi the way the scene focuses on her\n4.	⁠Vajpayee wasn’t dramatic about it. Look at Pankaj Tripathi’s eyebrow movement, too fake!\n5.	⁠Lacked the emotions of this scene- the right balance of frustration, disappointment, maturity, and determination\n\nIt’s not about mimicking, or looking like Vajpayee, it’s about the emotions of the scene, which he missed. He could have looked totally different, delivered completely different dialogue and yet succeeded if he had internalized the character and the situation!"
Raghubir yadav would have been a good choice i guess,He'd be perfect for a lal bahadur shastri biopic
"He has been acting the same way for the last so many years - limited scale, limited tones and zero versatility. While I am personally okay to give him full marks for the attempt to copy Atal, he missed a few things  - \n- Atal called “desh” a “desh”, not “des”\n- overdoing the hand and head movements",Finally! Someone said it.
I thought the same too. Not sure about those two but Manoj would have killed it,Vajpayee meets Bajpayee! Would have been an interesting title
"Now that I think about it, this guy could have done it way better than everyone else! Not the voice, but the essence of the scene!\n\n",He's so underrated I don't know why people r not giving Ashutosh Ramnarayan a role like this where he can show how brilliant as an actor he is
"He's trying too hard, perhaps a powerful veteran actor would have done more justice.","Paresh Rawal, what do you say?"
I saw the trailer and he is not convincing at all ....not even a little bit ...it looks like a movie produced by alt Balaji or ullu type shit ....,"I hope they see the reactions on this thread, and reshoot with better preparation"
I like him but tbh he has limitations as an actor.  Mostly he does the same kind of acting in all his movies. He is overrated by audience.\n   \nLike he said in that interview -' There is so much average work happening that even something slightly above average seems great '\nThis applies to himself too.,It's weird but i've noticed that Indian cinema audience always assumes people that are less good looking are better actors than those who are more good looking.
Poor voice modulation .,It's just Pankaj Tripathi with a big nose. Atal ji had a depth in voice while Pankaj Tripathi has a husky voice.
agree!\n\ni can see manoj bajpayee doing it\n\nthis feels like nawazudding doing thackrey,Nawaz's Thackeray though not perfect or great is at any rate better than Pankaj's Atal.
Best song of the movie and so much emotion from Neil Nitin Mukesh. I hope he makes a comeback.,He has a movie coming up with Maddy which I’ll watch tbh. His acting has always been good for me but I don’t see him being a commercial success :(
The iconic scene for all one sided lovers.,"Not just for one sided but for all ex lovers - the moment when the guy sees the girl he was madly once in love with, moved on with someone else and he's sad and happy at the same time. It's iconic!"
"It's a shame Neil didn't make it big. He had the looks, the talent and was a nepo too","True, but your last words got me"
"Unrelated question: what can I do to make my hair bounce like that while walking/running? I get that they probably used a fan while walking but, no way they bounced like that because of fan.",Blow-dry and dry shampoo to puff it up and make it jumpy. It won't work on greasy hair.
The song and lyrics perfectly fits the situation... miss you Mohit Chauhan ❤️,Bhai jinda hai abhi.
Which movie???,"New York\n\nStarring John Abraham, Katrina Kaif, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Irrfan."
True. He did use up all his acting talent here that there was nothing left in this [scene.](,Lmaoooooo\n\nI knew it was bad but didn’t realise it was that bad.
Song name?,Tune Jo Na Kaha by Mohit Chauhan from the movie New York.
There was a point where Saif was given national award for hum tum(Especially for marrying Rhea after her first husbands death in the movie) over Shahrukh’s Swades. Now you believe in awards? Performance or box office numbers?,That’s cuz his mother was part of the jury
"She is an awesome actress no doubt. The screenplay of this movie  was utter shit though, same was the case for thaf Karan Johar movie.\n\nBut the main problem is, who the hell even thinks Filmfare of all awards is meant to reward worthy people? Its a fucking sham.",That’s right. Filmfare? More like BribeFare.
imagine being yrf ki malkin still getting defeated to aloo,and that too in field of acting lol
Rani is incredible,Rani over Rocky ki Rani 🤣🤪
"Rani is the best actress in India currently. She has always been a great actress and now also. No Deepika, Alia, Samantha, Nayantara can do what she does.","I'll tell you something Rani is the best actress that has walked in Bollywood since the last 25-30 something years. \n\nShe's beautiful but not the prettiest.\nShe isn't the most honest or genuine human being either. Sometimes in media she comes off as annoying and stupid.\n\nBut despite all that nonsense, when it comes to performances she's the best. \nSo many films even multi- starrer films,  she has single handedly carried on her shoulders. \nDeserves a national award."
"No offence to her outstanding acting capabilities, but her performance in this film was super overdramatic.",It's because the screenplay was bad and the movie wasn't written well. \nBut she's a super fine actress.
"After watching the movie, and learning about the story of what happened..... Could not believe such idiotic country with such stupid laws existed. Boiled my blood.","Stupid law, well all countries are not like India where child services are non existent."
"I mean she was good, but dude even my mother who si a sucker for such movies, should be connecting that extra because of the motherhood connection told me first time, ""Kya hi overacting kr rhi h"" and I laughed. Thats just what it is. Too much overacting, and melodramatic and one dimensional, I think.","So true, i cringed looking at this clip only. No disrespect to her in general but this was too much overacting."
"My god, the overacting! I need a detox from this. And you think this deserves an award?","You got to understand Debika,the characters background to understand her mannerisms which are hyperbolic .. rani in her career has played subtle characters a lot of times .. for example she played a grieving mother in Talaash .. a diametrically opposite character"
Sorry but I cannot bear her acting. This is just way too hammy.,That means rani did good job
i think Bollywood didn’t find its default villain after Amrish Puri,I just wonder how was Amrish Puri in so many fucking movies. He's in at least 75% of 90s movies along with Anupam Kher.
Good in animal? \n\n>! He was good when he was on screen but he was on screen for a total of 15 minutes !! !<,But he was really good. I was rooting for him in the fight. And people clapped when he laid down on top of a battered Ranbir.
Sanjay Dutt is a default villain?,Since Agneepath he has been kinda default \n\nSon Of Sardar \n\nUngli \n\nPanipat \n\nKGF 2 \n\nShamshera \n\nLeo
Just be happy he's on screen he flopped as a hero\n\nAt least he's getting a second chance to have a career some don't get that,"He has earned that second chance. Worked so hard . And absolutely deserving of a comeback! His OTT stuff like Ashram, Class of 83 & Love Hostel are all solid."
>!He was barely there in the movie.!< Faltu ka hala hupa,"But agar Ranbir ne baaki ka movie pull off kar liya hai , then I'm fine with that!"
Spoiler\n\nHe was good for a few reasons\n\n1. Screen time was less\n2. He was mute\n3. He did not dance,Dance in nayo nayo ...
"Firstly, Sanjay Dutt? Default Villain? Since when?? Also, the reason for the hype of Bobby in promotions was simple - when the teaser came out and he had only 2 seconds in it, people went crazy. So they milked it till now, simple.","Sanjay dutt is now a pretty red hot actor in  South for antagonist roles, he managed to grab lead villan roles in some of the most talked about projects from south( kgf and leo). Bobby is definitely a great actor for villan role in ashram and love hostel, hence all the hype considering his previous track record."
"Just got back watching the movie, the first half is really good with very little to criticize. The second half is kinda boring and why did they have to make Ranbir fuck other women ? Like that goes totally against what kinda character he had portrayed throughout. Then again you can't expect a lot from a South India director. And people are liking these movies nowadays.  \n\n\nThings that could've been better \n\n1. CGI in general is bad like the massive gun and the end fight shadows.\n\n2. Forced character assassination of Ranbir by cheat with Zoya.\n\n3. The lead actress's performance sucks ! She just doesn't even know how fucking pronounce! Her acting sucked too.. \n\n4. Could've easily shell down the duration of film at least 30 mins less. I was kinda bored in second half but the climax was great ! \n\n\nThe positives :\n\n1- Actors ! My god ! Ranbir, anil Kapoor and lord Bobby along with Shakti Kapoor and the jatt squad did a fine ass job here.\n\n2. The BGM throughout the movie was just fantastic and didn't look forced\n\n3. The plot is really unique and actors did justice especially Ranbir ! \n\nOverall it's a 7/10 .","Your top 3 positives sum it up for me👌. His cousins squad was so good, loved them! And BGM was just outstanding. Lord Bobby 🔥🔥"
I want to see him in suave gorgeous older man romantic roles … maybe a hot professor 🔥,Ma'am you are married . Please lust after your husband like this. Leave this man alone.
"Saw this movie.\nEnjoyed it.\n\nNot many woke women will like this movie.\nBut this movie was made as a revenge for a critic review.\n\nSandeep reddy vanga (Director) confessed in an interview about how his film arjun reddy was negativity criticized by rajeev masand stating that the film lacked art but just had violence, blood,intimate scenes,vulgarity and lag scenes.... Which every movie does now.... Anyway....\n\nSo the director bet that he would make a more commercial movie... With commercial cast and with more violence and vulgarity.\n\nHe did it in animal movie but.... The art and storytelling is absolutely impressive.\n\nI would rate 7.5/10. A must go for action and adult emotion enjoyers.\nRest can watch Tiger mar gya and it's syndicate series.","I enjoyed everything before intermission , but after that was just shit, it was such a great movie in first half. 2nd half just gave me headache 🤦"
Can’t help but notice how cute and expressive that gunda guy is when compared to the current Bollywood heartthrobs…,He is a known stunt choreographer who is often casted as a side kick to villains in south movies. He does have unique expressions.
Screen Presence.  \nKick was such a fun movie. \nWish Salman’s health is better and he can make more entertaining movies.,What happened to his health?
,Selmun bhui has a tweet for every occasion
"When you said cameo, you mean the real salman running over while driving cameo?","During promotions Chetan Bhagat said that  Kick is a Salman Khan biopic which makes sense cause Devil has fun, dances weirdly, romances young women, tries to sing even though he can’t, is charitable and caring to children and most importantly drives (a bus) across footpaths and terrorizes pedestrians."
SRK in a negative role is just chef's kiss.,I think he can do also comedy roles great.\n\nKal Ho Na Ho\nMain Hoon Na\nBadshah\nKuch Kuch Hota Hai\nKabhi Kushi Khabi Gham\n\nHe kills every comedy scene
"Let’s be real, any SRK clip montage can be turned into a hype video.  He’s king for a reason! \n\n(Thanks for not showing his bald cap, the man can be a villain with HAIR😩)","Of course he could be a villain with hair. The real question is, why is the bald always the villain? He could be a hero without hair too."
"Fan was good if not the best, both of them are villains",I liked Fan a lot. He played the dopplegangers role well.
Isn’t it Sallu bhai who said he never wants to play a bad guy in a movie? Why not??? Look at SRK! A good actor is a good actor whatever role he chooses to play.,To be a good actor you first need to be an actor. Sorry to say sallu bhoi is not an actor he's just a superstar with some good performances that's it.
Is he a bad guy in Jawaan?,He will play both roles as i heard from leaks and rumours
Dope. He is underrated as villain,Not underrated but under utilized.
Great clip! He did Ram Jaane and Duplicate (well half of it) too. SRK was fearless in the 90s doing all kinds of movies whether they worked or not.,Then he became a superstar: )
I heard Rumours Jawan is a part of LCU...What is your thoughts friends?,And srk is the boss of Rolex? Wat else
"Mention all these movies.\n\nYou spoiled Don one for me, HR face removal","This scene from Don 2 is very popular, I am surprised you haven't come across this scene before. And anyways, it's a minor one, not big. And also it's a sign you should watch Don 2 asap."
They didn't include Asoka.,Very briefly and then he goes for reformation. These characters are villains through & through. Probably can be said about missing Duplicate.
Zinda is a solid workout track,Farhan as a director and an actor 👌
One of the best biopic movie ever made in bollywood,*the* best sports biopic.
"Still waiting for a bollywood movie like this one. Which inspires, rather than just being about love, relationships, and breakup like every other bollywood movie.",I mean this one has that more than most Bollywood films lol but I get your point
Still the best biopic along with dangal imo,And Paan singh Tomar
"Def an incredible movie. But, little ""fun"" fact: My dad also did track and field. He's coached teams to Olympics and Asian games, won medals himself at Asian games etc etc. Anyway....he Was Milkhas junior. Like, when he was in the youth national team, Milkha was the national team type junior. Acc to my dad, this dude is the vilest person he's ever met. 💀 \n\nApparently Milkha also made some declaration that ""if someone breaks my reford I'll give them x amount of money"" and when someone did, he was nitpicking their time and all and basically went back on his promise. \n\nObviously source: trust me bro ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",Can you give more examples of how he was vile?.
"Actually the reason shown is not true. He didn't win because he got overconfident. When he saw the other runners going past him, he couldn't think about going faster. Milkha Singh himself said this.",Melodramatic film mein liberty ke naam pe kuch bhi dikhaya tha. Bhaag Milkha ke fans ne Paan Singh Tomar dekhi hi nahi hai. Dekhenge toh pata chalega ke sports biopic mein conflict kaise dikhate hai
"This and neerja, two of the best of this genre",Dangal and Paan Singh Tomar
"Trendsetter? Paan Singh Tomar came before it! Bhaag Milkha was just a formulaic, overtly melodramatic mess.",True. This just dialed things back to usual. However From the downvotes looks like they nailed it.
what about his body? pretty sure not a runner body. and whole blaming aussie girl for his performance is too much.,"He didn't blame her. He was frustrated at first, but then he went ahead and apologized to her."
 this art of  =artofharsha on instagram,"Bahut badhiya, aapki permission ho toh main apni Insta story pe daal deta hoon! :)"
"Sir, your acting is otherworldly in Tumbbad, everybody is appreciating the movie a lot (which they should, I have watched it again in theatres), but your acting deserves more praise.\n\nMy question is - Would Rahi Anil Bharve be the director of Tumbbad 2 or someone else?","Rahi India ke bahut bade shows bana raha hai, he is very busy, so Adesh the co-director of Tumbbad will direct Tumbbad 2"
Is there a chance for Tumbbad extended cut with all the deleted scenes included ?,Agar OTT wale bahut saare paise de toh! 😜
Loved Tumbadd!!! Are you going to dive deeper into the mythology (more about hastar or other deities) in the next one. Will it have more horror elements??,"Bhai soch hi rahe hai, tumhare paas bhi koi idea hai toh share kar do! 😅"
Hi sir!! Where can we watch your short films? I really want to watch more stuff produced by you!,Dost uske liye banani padhegi pehle! Par aapne itna pyaar diya hai zaroor banauga! 🫶🏻
"Hello sir, will Tumbbad 2 revolve around Hastar or it plans to introduce a new entity or “pralay” would be focused there as teased in the teaser?",Bhai sab kuch aaj bata dunga toh film kyun dekhne jaonge tum? 😅
Sir I watched Tumbbad during this re release and truly speaking I am amazed by the work you and your team have put in. Especially the music was the epitome of building something so epic\n\nQuestion - Will there be a separate track for Tumbbad 2 or you'll adapt the same from the first film ?,"Nahin nahin, bilkul paise kharch karenge, naya track banayenge!"
"How do you know that a particular script will work, when a lot of things can also rely on execution?","Apne aap ko itna seriously nahin leta, sab kuch uparwale ke haath mein chhod deta hoon"
"Sir, what kind of Indian films do you like? 4-5 Bata do pls ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)","likh le bhai, Jaane bhi do yaaro, Andaz Apna Apna, Hera pheri, Welcome, Aur Hum"
Hi sir\nAapne tumbaad ki shooting kab start ki thi,Jab mere baal kaale hua karte the😂😅
Son Brings gun to a classroom...\n\nDad : I should send him to America.,lol he fit right in
Lol. Is there a wish fulfilment angle to this? Why does it feel like Vanga underwent this experience at some time and wishes he changed the end? Though he does have a point that bullies are cowards.,All the movies of Vanga are fulfillment of his fantasies in some way or other. And his protagonists are a reflection of Vanga himself.
Ye bht jaldi wapas aagaya gun leke nahi? Itni jldi to main kitchen se namak bhi na laa pau. 😭,Isliye wo animal hai tu insaan
"much more realistic option would be to hire goondas to beat up the people ragging and harassing the girl and make an example out of them\n\nwhich is what any rich person would’ve done, to keep them far from the trouble of getting into the mess while also teaching them a lesson",Realism ke liye movie dekhne nahi jaate bhai.
"The transitions between scenes in this movie are so seamless, that's one of the majors plus points of this movie.",But no one appreciates this artistic brilliance
Wow. This? This looks like it was written by a teenager. We all used to imagine what we would do if terrorists attacked our schools. This is on the same level.\n\nWhoever wrote this is still stuck at 13.,Lol no one was hit with the ricochet. Sanjay dutt KO Nahi baksha for AK toh ye kaun hai bhai Jo bindaas firing Kar Raha. \n\nLazy writing as always and it's enough to send chills down people's spine. No wonder this industry does so well.
Chills?\nThis scene?,Not just Chills it's chills from the spine (whatever that means lol)
This scene sets the tone for the entire movie by showing that women are helpless abla naaris and only a male figure brewing with testosterone and anger can save them. This movie is a teenagers idea of what real masculinity means.,Ofc thats the reality the sooner you accept the better for you 😂 women literally can't defend themselves alone that's the point why women council exists 😂
"Kabir Singh se scene uthake yahaan daal diya. Kabir Singh waala scene had a lot more substance. I don’t know what the fuck was this?! Kaunsa college hai jahaan yeh sab hota hai professor ke saamne? Aur kaun Ambani/Birla ki beti ko chedni ki aukaat rakhta hai, woh bhi college mein?! Logic, story, screenplay, kuch use nahi kiya is “father-son” movie mein.","Wahi toh, like seriously if Ranbir's papa is richest guy in india in this film then no in the right mind would ever try to tease or harras richest guy's daughter. And even if they do the father themselves would be involved in matter there will be zero need for overly dramatic pretentious dumb lil brother."
"Mujhe ye nahi samajh me aata hai ki agar ye bade baap ki bigdi aulaad tha who knew ki koi iska kuch nhi ukhad sakta tha, then so was his sister lol😭\n\nUsne khud hi kyon nhi un bullies ko boldiya ki janta hai mera baap kon hai👹\n\nYafir badass hona sirf ladkon ki skill hogi in vanga verse",Have you bothered to watch the film? She isn't like him. That's the point. She doesn't even stand up to her abusive husband.
"2000s was the Golden era for comedies, Akki was so good",I think his comedy role makes him the best actor but for his serious role I can’t really relate to him because in my childhood I just saw him doing comedy that’s all
"All my favourite comedy movies have Akshay Kumar in them. Hera Pheri, Welcome, Garam Masala, Bhul Bhulaiya etc. He should start doing these movies again and stop doing biopics and message movies.","khatta meetha as well, perfect mix of comedy and emotions"
Just watched Mujhse shadi karogi. What a hilarious movie,"It's a classic, have watched it mny times."
Also the Khaata-Meetha scene which also has Akshay and Asrani 😂😂,"""Hnn toh teri maa ki Shaadi h..."" ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
"It wasn't Akki, it was Neeraj Vora the writer!",Yup definitely agree but I think Akki was also so good in these Priyadarshan comedies.I doubt there is any other big star who could come close to him in this genre.
Could someone please hook me up with the names of the movies?,De Dana dan and bhagam bhag
Nisha munni hai na 😀,Toh sheetal kaun hai
I haven't watched either. Can someone plz tell me why on earth is Govinda wearing a disposable plate as a hat?,It’s just unnecessary prop to make scene more comic but nobody bothered to even look at it as the scene itself is so comically intense.\n\nBTW top movie is De Dana Dan and bottom movie is Bhagam Bhaag. Both movies are directed by Priyadarshan.
De dana Dan ka scene faltu mei dala. It was a terrible film. \nBhagam Bhaag was a masterpiece.,"Wtf. How was it a terrible film? It was much more enjoyable to me as a child than any other comedy film. The chaos felt so good and well written. Apart from the love plot line, i didn't find any problem in the movie."
Name of the movie?,De Dana Dan and bhagam bhaag
Literally no one doubts his abilities and there is no dearth of opportunities for him.\n\nHe is a recluse and doesn't want to work a lot.,>He is a recluse and doesn't want to work a lot.\n\nI really appreciate people like this. Keep your private life private and only come out for projects you truly believe in
"His filmography is limited but very memorable. Even in the films that didn't work, his role was very impactful. Apart from the comic work, his ""heavy"" movies like ""Gandhi, My Father"", ""Aakrosh"" and ""Section 375"" are also worth watching.","True - Gandhi, my father."
Him in humraaz👄👁,"His character in Humraaz, Race (mistyped with 3 first don’t know why I did that), and Dishoom all look same on paper yet have slight unique dimension to them."
"He is a great actor, I liked him more than Aamir in DCH",Aamir role was much versatile in nature.

"sir, vo APNI Mrs. hai kya andar?","Voh apni nahi meri Mrs hai, apna koi joint account nahi hai."
Joram seems to be a father's story. How was your connection with your father? Any funny anecdotes which have happened?,"I simply adored my father! I have never seen more gentle, more democratic person in my life! My mum was too authoritative, dad was not! He always took the back seat in the decisions, he only wanted his children to be graduate, after that they could do anything they wanted!"
how do you “marry the directors mind”?,"It is all about the meeting and conversation with the director. It's a relationship that doesn't get established in one day. We keep exchanging notes, I try to understand his world, his vision, and once that is clear to me - where my character is placed, that is when I start getting along."
"Nothing to ask, but just want to thank you for creating such beautiful films by enacting and characterizing such epic roles. You are just amazing!","Thank you so much for the appreciation, hope that I keep living upto your expectations!"
How come you never age? Please tell us your secret.,"Thank you very much first of all! Ask my bones, they tell you my real age xD"
What's a character you would want to play again and why?,"I never wanna play any role, again. I always find faults in my characters once the movie/show is out. I get miserable, but I know the time is gone, the age is gone and I cannot change things. So no point being miserable"
How did you get into the skin of Dasru's character in Joram?,Everybody's asked me this! And I can never answer it in 4-5 lines. All I can say is - everything starts and ends with the scripts! The approach I take is dictated by my interpretation of the character!
Who inspired you to become an actor?,"Acting fascinated me when I was too little. My parents used to take me to watch films, all the brothers and sisters used to tag along. Since the time, I was in 5th standard, the world on the screen used to mesmerize me. From that time on, I had the thought of doing this when I grow up!"
"In your opinion, what's the biggest change in Bollywood over the last decade?","That they're now depending a lot on scripts! When I started, scripts were not a thing! Secondly, a lot of female presence on the sets is seen!"
Will you ever direct a movie,Never say never! You never know what destiny has planned for you!
"Hii sir.\nFirst of all you are one of my favorite actors, i love your presence on screen. \n\n So my question is,  1. how important is the role of theatre in the making of an actor ? Unfortunately, the new crop of mainstream actors( from any background) in bollwood have very little to no serious theatre background. According to you , how much experience should a actor have in theatre whether he has a attended a acting school or not , to achieve a good base in their acting journey ?\n\n2. Which movie is your all time favourite.\n\n3. Any update on family man season 3 if you have any. I have already watched it on repeat 3 times.\n\n4. When you read the scipt of joram,  what is the one thing about it that made you do it.","It's the father-daughter bond! That one thing completely attracted me! And from that point on, it was only upwards till my pack up was announced!"
I have neither watched movie nor I’m on social media. Now I know why my husband was playing with our daughter keeping her bottle on her head🤦🏻‍♀️,“I am not on social media “ my reaction->\n\n![gif](giphy|XmkZDeMLbeU2fyTVbB|downsized)
He saw the Dog wala reel 😝,"Yeah, saw that few days back. I must say Lord Bobby is such a sport..!!"
Lots of movies have scenes that are not choreographed. Why is she amazed like this is a big deal?,Lots of movie scenes are not as viral as this scene.

Where can watch the whole interview? Any idea which show is this,It’s on YouTube Bollywood now

"Aamir's tapori comedy acting is so underrated, nailed it in Rangeela as well..",Watch his expressions when he says\nWapas rakh.. Mai paise doonga\n\nTeri shadi Madhuri Dixit se ho rahi hai 😅😅
Batla Danny is the best thing about this clip.,Initially I thought he was calling him butler Danny. Later came to know batla means short
Do Mastaane Chale Zindagi Banane,Aamir and Salman's dance in this song  on top of the bus was not as appreciated as Chhaiya Chhaiya 😅😅
"To me, “uncle aap dande pe baithiye, dande pe” takes the cake.",Haan dandi par try kariye.. Uncle dandi par try kariye\n\nPhir mai chalaunga kaise 🤣🤣
I still remember laughing my ass off at that paying the bill bit,Aamir has got the best scenes..\nChampion of football team 😂

Only movie Indian and American that I've watched multiple times or will want to watch with close friends,"It's a laugh riot from start to end. \nNo sad or dull moments, no serious fights"
Maine 50 lakh maange the aur ye saale thaili mai 50 lakh laaye hain ? \nRobot - sir lakh lakh ke 50 cheque hoyenge sir\nUltimate one liners,Ye firoti ki rakam hai ya maiyat ka chanda

Crime master gogo Jaan na chahta hai ki heere kaha hai, where are the diamonds\n\nAbsolute gold","I think this is the only film where if you have not seen it, you will not understand / laugh at the dialogues."
"It has been 25 years but Andaz Apna Apna has not lost any of its madcap fun. The film released on November 4, 1994, and has established itself as a cult hit.",Will be 29 years this November.\n\nKids who saw this film have become parents themselves 😅
The first female superstar of Indian cinema for a reason. Also Gauri Shinde should direct more.,"and the last one too.\n\ntamil,telugu ,malayalam and ultimately hindi. she conquered all fronts.\n\ninvincible under the sun. to the very end"
It's not acting. It's much more than that. \n\nEach scene of hers is an acting lesson.  \n\nI had tears in my eyes and even imagined trauma after watching this scene.,Each scene of here is an acting lesson - so true.
she proved with this film that why she was better than madhuri and her rivals.\n\n  sridevi will be ranked among the greats like madhubala after 21st century .\n\nultimately invincible under the sun,>ultimately invincible under the sun\n\nhold up do I read vagabond's line here
How far did the apple fall from the tree 😂 \n\nSridevi 🗿 \n\nHer kids 🤡,"Boney-anil-sanjay kapoor family spoils their kids. It's to the point where even if one of their grown ass kids shits on the table, the whole family will rise up and give a standing ovation, praising the shape, smell and consistency. Look at how entitled they behave. The only grounded ones are Arjun, his sister and Rhea."
One should also appreciate her acting in MOM..\n\n,क्या चिल्ला रहे थे तुम लोग ? बुला अपनी माँ को…\nलो आ गई उसकी माँ !
"Can we agree how rude that lady on the counter is to her? Like seriously.\n\nEdit: I know she is an Actor, a really good one. Hence we hate her character.","Yeah I don't buy this scene. I like the idea of it, because this is definitely a fear any foreign language speaker would have, and especially a traditional housewife like this. I know my mom would relate 100%. But in this scene everyone is acting oblivious as if this woman is just pure mentally challenged rather than the obvious of, ""oh okay this women doesn't speak English, this is annoying for me but let me speed it along and help her out"" rather than repeatedly asking her what type of coffee she would like. Like it's clear this woman doesn't understand English, I think in this situation even if a worker or people behind her were annoyed, they still wouldn't have acted that bad."
Unrelated but Are waiters this rude in America ??? I'm pretty sure someone would have helped her out in an irl situation.    Anybody. She's clearly struggling to understand and some stranger would have come to rescue,I know in France it's very common if you struggle with french.
What's there any award nominations/wins for this movie? The acting here is nothing short of LEGENDARY.,Nominations yes not award cuz that year had Vidya in Kahaani then PC In Barfi
She literally portrait 99% Indians in foreign countries,not 99% but yeah. Even other immigrants especially tourists travelling abroad with no knowledge of english for sure.
"Am I the only one that feels that the lady wasn't rude or wrong to be annoyed? Even back the first time I watched the scene, Sridevi's character's behavior did annoy. Why were others supposed to make time and space for her issues?\n\n\nI always hated customers that would decide their menu when their turn arrives instead of standing at the side, reading the menu and only joining the line once they have figured out what they wanted. \n\n\nI do understand that she did not understand English and required time to communicate but she could have still stood by the side of the line, looked up the menu or asked around and joined the line once she understood how she was going to communicate her order.","Yeah you are right, everyone has their own problems to deal with and no one really owes kindness and understanding to strangers on top of all that, but its still nice to receive that kindness from someone when you are having a bad day. However no one is ""in the wrong"" in this scene. \n\nIn this scene in the movie, she was out on her own for the first time in a new place with a very limited understanding of what was going on around her, without anyone helping her. She is also struggling with who she is and her self-confidence. First times can be challenging when it comes to anything. We dont know what we don't know and cannot predict possible challenges. That comes with experience. You can see these possible solutions as obvious now because you are accustomed to the drill. She wasn't, at least at that point in the movie."
"He is literally dancing on the roof of the moving train...can't get any better than this.\n\nJust FYI, this song was included in Denzel Washington's movie Inside Man.","""And therein, as the Bard would tell us, 'lies the rub'.\n\n*Cue to play one of the best fucking song ever*"
"A timeless classic.....The lyrics, that energetic voice by Sukwinder Singh and that energy by SRK takes it to another level.\n\nAn absolute banger!!!\n\nDil Se Album is top tier.","It's the best album, man. Satrangi re is still my fav. Lyrics uff, man. I don't think any album of any movie can beat this one."
This is ooty btw. Archies is also shot here,"Yeah. Its a toy train, running on a narrower gauge track. I remember sitting in it as a kid many years ago."
All credits to cinematographer Santosh Sivan & Mani Ratnam as well,Also to Farah khan
"The movie is so complex, SRK’s character being manipulated by cunning Manisha Koirla’s character. Loves is blind and he could not see through or he was hoping to turn her around.. I still can’t decide if Manisha’s character was also in love ?","I don’t think she was ever truly in love with him. But I do think she found herself weak at times in his presence, and possibly wondered what life would be like as a regular girl with him. She definitely envied him and his life, and also felt jealousy briefly (of his fiancée). But she just didn’t have any time for love."
The only problem was that the timing of the song in the movie was pretty weird like bro just met the girl and now she's gone and this song plays,That whole movie screenplay writing was bad  imo.
"Silly question, but let me ask anyway. What actually is cinematography? What is it that a cinematographer do?",I have answer to your second question. Cinematographersa do cinematography.
"Jab  we met  , holds a special place in my heart","Unpopular opinion but it is terrible. All because of Geet. She's just narcissistic and only thinks about herself. \n\nBina family ko bataye bhag gayi. Aur bhaagi yo bhaagi, apne BF ko tak nahi bataya. Fir uski BF ne jab apni family manage karke apna ghar chorke usse shaadi karne gayi, she rejected him. \n\nAgar reject hi karna tha to pehle hi kar dete, faltu me bechare ko itne dur kyu je jana."
"Socha na tha was a great movie, very subtle and gentle romantic movie.\nJab we met.",Due hard Socha na tha fan.. it's such a natural film with great chemistry! As if it's some real video
A lot of these films were disasters to flops back then . The biggest romcom hits were \nAjab Prem and Partner .,"Only Socha Na Tha, Anjaana Anjaani, Break ke Baad flopped.. rest were super hit movies..\n\nDil Bole Hadippa isn’t really a romcom.. and it was an okayish movie.."
Hum Tum was way ahead of its times….,Or 15 years after Harry Met Sally
I hope Jaane Tu re-releases & the music across these are still on loop.\n\nImagine the kids now would have no such film on which they will look back fondly.,"People are going crazy for movies like jawaan,kgf pushpa these days 😂"
"As they say nostalgia clouds our judgement. Many of these were bashed at the time of their release (Anjaana Anjaani, Dil Bole Hadippa, Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, I Hate Luv Stories) or people didn't even bother about them (Socha Na Tha). \n\nMy favorite is Salaam Namaste and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani.",I rewatched ajab prem ki gajab kahani as I watched it on a school trip and had really fond memories. But the movie now seems so dated. The 2nd part was a bit absurd. I shouldnt have rewatched it. Had better feelings before and they got ruined
"and some underrated ones Partner,Dostana,Pyaar Ke Side Effects,Dil Maange More and Ahista Ahista",ahista ahista isn’t really a romcom imo
My playlist is filled with all these albums,you’ve great taste then
bollywood was kdrama back in 2010s,They already started to adopt the beard fashion after 2012
Namaste London is utterly boring and overrated!,I agree! I have never understood the love for that movie.
He simply cannot find the biryani that is to his liking.,You have biriyani at weddings?! It's a big thing if i find paneer in the weddings i go to.....
"Bollywood has stereotyped these actors big time. In every movie, \nSHARUKH KHAN- widens his arms \nBHOI- rubs his nose \nRanbir- walks out of weddings",>Ranbir- walks out of weddings\n\nAtleast we got bangers out of it.
I think Rockstar's wedding is the only one he stayed in and didn't end up leaving dramatically,In Barfi he stayed in his own wedding 🤥
"Next move, walk out of your own wedding 😅",in the last one he did TJMM with shraddha
For me Jogi Mahi is best song out of them. .idk why I find it even better than channa mereya,Cuz it was the only one which made Ranbir satisfied and happy. Rest all were him leaving cuz of jealousy and sadness.
Bhaisab channa mereya song me to full ready hoke pagdi wagera pehen ke fir gaana gaa ke nikle the ye janaab,You mean channa mereya?
The hair pieces in his initial days were atrocious... Especially Bachna Ae Haseeno.,Was that transplant or a patch?
That tere rukhse apna rasta stanza is one of the greatest outro to the sone ever,Ohh definitely for sure it is indeed
Playing the same-ish characters for more than a decade!,Alrrady following Tom Cruise’s career path.
"In his defence, none of them were his own wedding 🤣👍🏻",Except the >!last one. It’s his own engagement in TJMM!<
"One of my favourite movies, one of the best bgm, such a great reveal. When Om realises it's Shanti and waves at her 🥹","BGM was dope, when will bollywood start releasing official BGM?"
Om Shanti Om was the most 'Bollywoody' bollywood movie ever,>Bollywoody' bollywood movie ever\n\nCan you elaborate?
"When you put it like that, the change in the BGM literally make me teary it was sooo good",yeah the change in BGM was really sad and made the scene 10x better.
that final look before she vanishes no matter how much times i watch still gets me,"have you seen madhumati though? when this happened in madhumati it blew my frickin MIND! i think i was in class 4 or 5 maybe and that end was etched into my brain, and its in no glamorous studio shot either...... that movie is a MASTERPIECE,  they did it way way better than OSO....."
That bgm🤌,Wtf is bgm ?
It was a carbon copy of two masterpieces: Karz and Madhumati. The film itself acknowledges it.,"Yeah even though it’s not original, it’s still a great scene imo, and should be considered as an homage to Madhumati, rather than a copy."
Can someone tell what was this scene about?,You can read the wiki of Om Shanti Om for the plot. This is where the final plot twist is revealed.
Movie should have ended in the first half.,"that was the boring part.. except for song sequences, until someone got set on fire"
"They needed an ATBB like Maine Pyaar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, DDLJ, Raja Hindustani which they never got.",And they never in future (kind of cinema they're doing these days)
"Hrithik, Ajay, and Akshay are in the immediate next tier to the 3 khans in Stardom.\n\nCombined they are called the Big6 of Bollywood.\n\n  \nThe issue with Hrithik is that there are too few movies and character roles like Super 30 and Vikram Vedha. No rom-com or romantic movie has been made in almost two decades now. Has done action every now and then and that has mostly paid-off well. \n\n  \nAjay and Akshay - too many movies. Like too many. Only Akshay gets called out for too many movies while Ajay is guilty of being the same. Too many movies lead to oversaturation things like Runway 32 vs Drishiyam 2.  \nAnd then Bhola vs Shaintaan, and recently Singham 3 vs Auro mein kahan dum that.\n\n  \nAudience has many opportunities to watch them hence they skip a few, and watch some. Hence not every movie becomes a hit.","The laid back attitude of Hrithik, he is top talent - could have done much more, movie goers loss,I'd say"
They leaned towards action in the decade of romance and still came out on top. Both Ajay and Akshay had their moments of being the best in different decades especially in the 00s. They ARE big.,"[Read in Akki's voice]\n\nKoi baat nahi... Hota hai...... Jane do usse. Bacche ki jaan loge Kya?\nMain samjhata Hoon..... Ek min.... Ek min.\n\n\nIdhar aa Bhai OP.\nDecade nahi, year.... YEAR. \n00s mein Kahan decade ghusayega?"
"The number of films they'd release..\n\nA fan would be less inclined to rewatch a movie in cinema if he knows the next one is just around the corner..\n\nLike in 2012, Akshay had Housefull 2, OMG, Rowdy Rathore, Khiladi 786, and Joker..\n\nChallo Joker ko discount krdo because it's shit, and now you have 4 movies which are all good watches of different styles as well, and it is clear that the business of movies would eat each other's.. \n\nSo 1 flop, 2 blockbusters, 1 superhit and 1 above average movie..\n\nAjay had Tezz, Bol Bachan and Son of Sardar in the same year..\n\nNow one movie that flopped, but 2 that became big hits..\n\nSame year, Salman had only Ek tha Tiger and Dabangg 2..\n\nOnly 2 movies with good quality and both became blockbusters..\n\nSalman had only kick the next year, while both Ajay and Akshay had a combined total of 6..","Akshay didn't give a flop from Holiday to Good newz. \n\nHoliday, Entertainment, Baby, Gabbar, brothers ,Singh is bling, airlift, houseful 3, rustom, jolly LLB 2, toilet, GOLD, PADMAN, MISSION MANGAL, KESARI, HOUSEFULL 4, GOOD NEWZ. \n\n17 HITS in 5 years is a mini industry in itself."
It seems people have very rosy tinted view of akshay BO performance in 2000s.\n\nThey will be in for a surprise if they look up his films performance,The reason he had taken Canadian citizenship was because he felt that his career was over in Bollywood
"Akki had a good shot in the 2000s but then he chose some lousy scripts. He had a big overseas market too. It all went down. Then when he chose good scripts, built back goodwill, and nearly came to that 250-300 crore level, COVID struck. Bad luck.\n\nAjay, all due respect, isnt in the same level as Khans/HR/Akki/RK. Ive never met anyone who calls themselves an Ajay fan. He is not consistent and gives movies with horrible openings even in his good phases.","Ajay doesn't do the same genre of movies again and again. He always tries to do something different. Yes his films open on an average note, but if the film gets a good WOM, it will work wonders. In short, banda badi race ka nahi, lambi race ka ghoda hai. He's got a laid back attitude. People don't talk much about him because he's never in the news. He always stays low and avoids paps as much as he can."
What are you talking about? Ajay and Akki have insane fanfare.,But their movies are struggling to open well at the box office. They didn't have a grip on the mass audience! P.S.:- read my different comments as well.
"I think if we take away the recency bias then Akshay was probably as big as them especially in the 2010's. He was constantly giving hits, a massive fan following. \n\nThe second point is, in recent times Khan's don't do as many movies anymore....at max 1 movie a year (that number goes down for Amir) so they have somewhat maintained that aura.","Akshay has only given two 2+ crore footfalls movie, meanwhile Salman and Aamir were consistently giving 3+ crore footfall movies in 2010s, Srk was in his down phase but he still gave one 2+ crore footfall movie in Chennai express and a near 2 crore one in HNY.\n\nKhans were always a league above."
"Several reasons. Their make or break moments came in 90s itself. SRK became King Khan simply because of the wide repertoire of performances that he delivered over years. In 90s SRK made a name for himself as the romantic badshah. He was fortunate to get movies like DDLJ, Baazigar and KKHH that catapulted him to stardom. Later, he attempted movies that showed him mature as an actor. \n\nAamir’s reinventing of himself came in early 2000s with a variety of different styles adopted by him. Focusing on one movie in a year, he managed to get marketed as a person who puts all efforts to a movie and became popular as a perfectionist. ( I don’t agree with that moniker for him.)\nSalman became what he is due to various reasons. Controversies were associated with him which added a new charisma to him. His acting skills were nowhere near Ajay or Akshay but he had amassed a big fan following even without those skills. \n\nAkshay resorted to typecast himself as the Khiladi kumar and not experiment much until last two decades. He has managed to do well ever since but the fans of Khan Trio have been loyal. His fan following has grown in last few years with performances touching relevant subjects in the society. \n\nI feel Ajay has been unfortunate. He has been an underrated actor. He has experimented and accepted roles his age as well at a time when a 40 - 50 year old actor played a late twenty guy. I feel he deserved better from audiences.",Salman is a better actor than Ajay. Ajay struggles with romance and comedy. He's good only with intense scenes and action.
"They are in the same league as khans if you are judging stardom on the basis of box office then please understand stree 2 , Kabir singh , uri all the films are literally earned way too much without any big stars. So, box office is never the parameter now as stree 2 already crossed the earnings of pathan. As far as fan following are concerned you should see rural population too where people love Ajay and Akshay way too much than khans.Gone are the days where you decide who is the bigger stars based on the box office as nowadays films are the bigger stars. Otherwise please declare Rajkumar rao as the greatest superstar.","What you listed are the exceptions not rule.\n\nIf you have to make a blockbuster movie you think you'll choose Salman, SRK , Aamir or Vicky and Rajkumar? \n\nNot based on acting or quality of script but straight blockbuster. Any sane person will choose khans if they strictly have to make a blockbuster movie."
Ab isko bhi 10 saal ho jayenge 😭,WHAT THE ACTUAL F
Re-watch value is insane for this movie.,Agreed. I have watched it several times in Youtube and was so excited to see it in Netflix UK recently.
Can we have this Salman back?,Let’s first have that Kabir Khan back. If the Director is back then he could make it with anyone.
Watched it ..even the religious angle does not look cringe like singham returns...beautiful movie,"If you would remember, this movie was criticized a lot back in the days and there were political debates regarding it. The way I see it, you showed India Pakistan unity and tried to spread love and peace then right wingers would get triggered unfortunately. How can you show so much peace between hindus and muslims and come to a reasonable solution."
The moment where the guy attempt to sale munni to a brothel and salman enters. ABSOLUTE FUCKING CINEMA. 🙌🏻,Hanuman Chalisa bgm 🤩🤩🤩
"Story by Vijayendra Prasad - father of SS Rajamouli. If you peel back, some great Bollywood movies have the thoughts and work of people from other regions…",So true and not discussing of how good/bad the movie Animal was but tbh I was literally shocked how a South Indian director has literally made the accurate depiction of Sikhs and not like some funny comedic caricature as depicted in most Bollywood movies except for movies like Border. I remember even many Punjabi actors/singers praised this.
Can we agree to the fact that this was the last time we saw salman bhai acting for the last time?,Sultan was nice as well
Bajrangi bhaijaan is the new Swades!,Nah. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is watchable
Story written by a telugu person,And why is that relevant or worth mentioning
"It's not that great movie. It would have been one of the best movies, if he was not the lead. He can't even act.",I guess you're the odd one out
"Yep, the K3G is supposed to be an homage to the KKHH scene!",Kjo would have thought of planting an Easter egg for his fans.
every kjo movie is homage to every kjo movie. A good way to hide the lack of creativity you know.,Happy Cake day 🎉
You must be pretty daft.,"Maybe, or maybe they're just not as obsessed with films like the rest of us lol"
"why Ajay , I inocently still linger upong shipping kajol x srk.",Didn’t SRK marry Gauri before Ajay married Kahlo?
"KJo even used Amitabs dialogue from K3G in RRKPK. Exactly like this, gender reversal.",There were Kaun Banega crorepati dialogues too in k3g
"I'm sorry but how did we enjoy this cringe? Imagine like kriti and kartik doing it, people would rip the movie apart","Don't worry box office addicts will bring excuses like ""good for its time"" blah blah."
Same movie. KKHH right?,Car scene is from Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham
"Real life example of..\n\n""zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nahi, Babu moshay.""\n\n#TrueLegend","""its the life in the years that matter, not the years in the life."""

"This is too much of a filmy version where the interviewers seem to be condescending. In reality,  this discussion mostly likely were in a very calm manner and questions were asked to unnerve the candidate and to test his mettle, so no need of slapping vlapping. If in reality interviewers were so condescending,  they wouldn't have selected him at all due to ego.","Even the scene in Dangal where Amir Khan's character is locked up, didn't happen in real life. So yeaah, film hai tho film ke tarah dekhna padhta hain. It's a thin line between reality and creative freedom"
"This was my least favorite scene in an otherwise 10/10 movie, the interviewers were so caricaturish I couldn't take them seriously.","Should've recreated the scene around the original interview, afterall at the end, everyone knew he was going to be selected. And yes, the overall movie was very well balanced."
this shit ain't happening real,This scene might not be accurate but if you watch the interview of Manoj it really happened. He got a bit nervous at first after the question. Seeing him a bit tensed the board member offered him a glass of water. And yes he actually made the statement afterwards. \nIt might seem impractical but these candidates are really that sorted and intellectual to give such amazing replies.
"Basically a YouTube viral video's idea, I've seen this many times before this movie",Looks like an Indian version of a Dhar Mann video.
"I dont know what he is interviewing for, so I maybe wrong. But tbh, Communication matters a lot in a lot of roles. You do your job with others, not in isolation and good communication is a must for collaboration. English is a primary language of communication in many industries. How will you be effective if you cant communicate properly?",My guess is this is UPSC. based on this very very short clip I think he can communicate in English he’s just not very proficient in it. Which should be fine for service commission jobs.
Idk why but I can’t sit through such forcefully preachy movies. This scene is cringy as hell.,Yes. Those who have been actual UPSC Aspirants know that this scene is entirely unrealistic.
"I wish he pulled the even more cringe sugar and milk analogy, that would have certainly caused a few pukes.",Sorry for my ignorance but what are you referring to?
"Unpopular Opinion: I didn't really like this movie. Don't get me wrong, Vikrant acted his ass off and proved that he is one of the best actors of this industry as of now but I didn't really like the movie",Same. But I blame the hype this subreddit created for the movie rather than the movie itself.
In what world does this movie deserve a 9.2 IMDB rating,Because people thought it was a great movie?
"Even if it makes any point , why don't upsc include other languages from india?",There are literally 22 languages included in upsc
"This is one of my favorite scenes of all time. It is so well written, directed and enacted.",Which movie ? 🥰
All 5 people in this scene (including the plumber) were fantastic. \n\nSiddharth and Fawad ki acting se it came across that Fawad always played a part in cooling down things while Siddharth just went into a corner and froze and shut it all out.,"Yeah what the narrator fails to see is the reason Fawad or Sidharth aren't doing much initially is because they're acting exactly like children who were brought up under parents who constantly fight, with Fawad being the elder sibling trying to calm them down.\n\nThe main part of their acting kicks in when the siblings ignore the parents and then start fighting each other but that isn't included here."
The youtube video creator is force fitting this example to sound intellectual.,"Agreed\n\nIt really feels like he sees two seasoned actors and two comparatively new ones so he just dismisses the latter as ""soulless acting"". Anyone who saw Kapoor And Sons would agree that Fawad was one of the best things (if not THE best thing) about the film."
I was amazed of thr plot twists in the movie.,Which one shook you the most?
"Sidharth is the only weak one here but since he doesn't have a lot to do, the scene works.\n\nI disagree about Fawad, he was brilliant here","Comparison is not between Siddarth and Fawad, but the both of them AND seasoned artists like Rajat Sharma  and Ratna Pathak. \nFawad may be better than Siddarth, but there's multitudes of dimension and depth from where Fawad ends and where the both of them start. \n\nThat's not to say, that this is his permanent state. Rajat Sharma and Ratna Pathak are at a point that someone like Fawad and Siddarth can and hopefully will work up to."
Says a guy in most monotone voice.,He’s narrating not acting
One of the most underrated Indian movies.,"How is it underrated? It was superhit at the box office and was nominated for Best Film at all the awards that year, winning 5 Filmfare Awards, only losing out to a juggernaut like Dangal. \n\nBut yes I get your sentiment. It will be remembered even more dearly in the coming years."
Absolutely disagree. All four actors did a phenomenal job in this movie and in this scene.,Five. The plumber was awesome.
Fawad Role Was Rejected By Lot of actors,Also by Shahid and ARK
"I literally cannot notice anything visibly bad about anyone in this scene, all did well, no one in a theatre is going to realize this much unless they have like some crazy acting experience",It feels like there was a good vs bad comparison but we only saw the good part of it.
No matter How many times have I watched this. Every time I tear up.,"Same, sometimes not even watching whole scene just listening to song alone makes me teary."
Such a well made movie! This came out when I was in 12th and the pressure to perform according to society norms was real 😭,Its even worse now..
This is the Bollywood I'm missing these days,Same. I really am not enjoying action movies and the craze around achieving numbers. Mixing art and capitalism sucks :(
"I was diagnosed with adhd & mild autism in my early 30s, but I watched this movie as a teen and I related so freaking hard to Ishaan. It was like watching myself but of course I had no idea what these issues were. It was just a relief to feel seen and heard, to feel like I’m normal and not “weird” for being so slow.",Off-topic: How did you get the diagnosis? Did you go to a specific doctor or did you opt for an online diagnosis? What changed after the diagnosis - did you get any medication that helped? TIA.
"It's not just about acknowledgement. In the movie, Aamir had never seen Ishaan smiling, yet he painted a picture of him smiling, which was something Ishaan had forgotten at that time. Aamir painted a picture of how he wanted Ishaan to keep smiling, just from his imagination. It was beautiful ❤️","I think he did smile in the rushes of when he is being taught by Aamir. I remember him smiling while playing pacman, I think"
This movie is top 10 bollywood. The “Maa” song is just 💔,"""Tujhe sab kuch pata hai na maa, meri maa"" 🥹"
Haha jokes on you.. I never see this movie to avoid crying.. Proceeds to be sad,One of the best thing Bollywood has ever produced
"When he be putting effort to learn words and his dad sees him after his interaction with Aamir and tears up, That scene reduces to me to a puddle. Masterpiece",Baap thoda chutiya laga tho
"I have adhd. I was 15 years old when the movie released. I related to so much to this movie. And after i was diagnosed with Adhd at the age of 30 last year, now I cant watch this movie. It will break me. I have suffered so much due to adhd and due indian concepts of “hardwork”, “sucess” and “achievements”","I can relate to this comment so hard. I have undiagnosed ADHD and in my middle 30s now I started to realize that ""it was not my fault"". It took me 30+ years to understand that what I have is ADHD which I'm still struggling with."
Where is this Aamir Khan? I hated his acting in LSC,Aamir Khan hasn't gone anywhere. And his acting in LSC was good too but you people don't acknowledge it just coz it flopped

"Same movie. The legendary scene where Salman literally put their photo in mandir & doing aarti. Wth were they even thinking? Even when watching it with parents,even they laughed at how stupid & over-the-top portrayal it was.\n\nAnd on that point,literally all the 4 biological sons turned out to be bad,while the adopted one was good. I understand their point was to show the orphan knew value of parents,but having no less then 4 sons & all 3 daughter-in-laws being evil makes me question their upbringing tbh. As Alok only got money from them,not any sanskar,and he turned out good.",">As Alok only got money from them,not any sanskar,and he turned out good.\n\nBruh! 🤣🤣\n\nValid point.

I mean in his defence \n\nThey're the ones trying to sleep with all the lights on,How is that a defense. Did that make him believe they were awake..?
"Is it a type writer or a DJ ? Do you guys really think this typewriter is so loud that they can hear it inside a closed room making noises from at least 25 feet away. If they can, I would suggest them not to talk in there or the person might hear what they are talking about.","Be honest, have you ever used a typewriter YOURSELF? I have and it is very loud and it was night time so obviously sound traveled further. Plus it was a small apartment so the bedroom wasn't 25 feet away."
"Maybe he did not realize he was disturbing. But the way you say it matters. That's most hurtful! He probably doesn't know how to handle a computer, big deal. \n\nHe was not disturbing them intentionally - they could have been more polite and loving about it.","Bro he worked at the bank office for his whole life(stayed at the same position i think), in India computers were used on a regular basis(banking sector) since the 1980's. He knows how to use a computer but that doesn't portray kids in a bad way so they used a typewriter."
"Also Main Hoon Na is the only movie that incorporates the masala element well in my opinion. Its a got a perfect balance of romance, comedy, action and all.",Credit to Farak Khan for that
"Every Villain is the hero of his own story.  \nTrivia : Nana was offered this role first. Apparently, he rejected it because he believed Raghavan's POV was right and didn't like Radhvan was portrayed to be the villain. Then, Farah(On Srk's recco) went to Kamal Haasan. Kamal rejected it coz he didn't want to have lesser screen time than any hero in any Hindi film. Finally, Suniel Shetty came on board.","No, Kamal refused it because he was directing a Tamil film at the time. He also had issues playing a terrorist."
Grey villains and heroes is what makes a great movie. That's why Joker is such an iconic character and Dark Knight a classic. Pathan tried that and John played the role pretty well only to be let down by storyline and poor vfx.,The best example of this trope is killmonger in black panther.
"This explanation is more than, what Sunil Shetty read in the script .",You gotta prove your point with facts
"Great write-up, I agree with most of these points and Ragahavan was one of the best villians ever in bollywood imo too but i disagree with this bit. \n\n>He wanted to stop project milaap because he thought peace with pakistan would compromise India's security\n\nThat wasn't the point of Ragavan's character, he only didn't want Project Milaap to succeed because of his deep rooted hatred towards Pakistan because his son was killed, that's why Khan turned against him, and told him it wasn't his personal war, if it was actually misguieded nationalism then Khan wouldn't turn against him.",That Raghavan character was as far from reality as possible.
"Agreed, he will probably be in the top 5 villains in hindi cinema for me. \n\nFor me no one can top Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadhir Singh.",in gow everyone was top villains.
Prashant Narayanan in Murder 2,That character must be wild
he will be a hero for a lot people atleast for the idelogy part right?,Ofc. Pakistan is a failed state run by terrorists who have always betrayed us. And given that this movie came a few years after the Kargil war where we faced ultimate betrayal from Pakistan is shocking.
OP do you idolize KK Menon from Shaurya as well?,"Arey of course, who can forget that"
How abt Vidyuat Jamwal from Force??,He was a beast
I understand what you're trying to say but this film was a Hit,"Commenting on The sad thing is these types of movies are flop in India and movies like Animal is a blockbaster !!...\n\n1. Pink got remade in other languages. So you need to include the BO records of those two to compare animal BO records pan India.\n2. Neither rape went down after PINK nor rape went high after ANIMAL release. I don’t have stats nor direct correlation. \n3. I liked both movies. Yes. I like the Range Rover bgm, staging of quarrel between Ranbir and jiju during bday party, jiju killing bgm, body double scene etc etc. I see movie as movie. I’m not gonna go to my high school crush and tell her her pelvis is big nor take a Ak47 to kill the harassers of my sisters. For me movies are like books. There are filthy bad ideologies book too. \n\nFor people saying, In a country like India where sex crimes are high movies like animal are danger. Ok, fix the root cause, not the symptoms. Root cause is strict laws, enforcing those laws, equal level laws for both genders (this is after recent Atul Subash case), sex education etc etc. \n\nPeriod."
You are brainless to say Pink is flop.,"I love pink but op is a fool to think I’d pay 400rs to watch it on day 1 and then also expect whole country to watch it again and again!\n\nThere is a reason a movies like dangal baahubali and pushpa are top grossers! They have rewatch value, Pushpa being the exception that it had mid story.\n\nI can’t imagine kids loving this no means no scene! I can’t imagine families going to theatres multiple times just to watch this scene!\n\nOp is just an idiot"
"Let's face the truth. Animal succeeded because of its excellent marketing. The teaser, trailer and music, all were top notch quality. It created a genuine intrigue about what the movie is about. Audience wanted a fresh story on screen, something different from the shit movies bollywood seems to be making these days. \n\nI don't think people came out of the theatre saying it is mind-blowing movie. It was an average movie with good acting performance and excellent music integration.",finally someone said it... Everyone tries to problems in animal yeah there are problems in animal but we can't deny the music and editing it's top notch.. The director himself is the editor of the movie it's hell of a work
"Yeah Rolls Royce is a better car, but we still buy more Maruti????\n\nSo what's your point OP??\n\n\nCustomer is free to choose as per their taste. Stop thrusting your pauedo-elite shit on others 🤡",Don't do it bro. Comments dekhke pata chal Raha h sbka dimag. Ye bhi nhi samjhenge. How and why to compare😄
It won a National Award so shut the fuck up,The OP didn't talk about awards at all. Getting an award and reception in theatre are two different things !
Pink was hit. But it was a low-budget movie and had no big star.\n\nComparing it to a movie at Pan India level is a joke.,No big star? I think we all know who the real joke is here.
"Amitabh Bachchan gave one of his best performances in his whole career and was a great hit. Even his ""superwoman"" dialogue is iconic in this movie. What are u talking about?",You think he watched 'pink'?
I love how Soojit just crystallized the message to just one simple thing NO means NO,"It’s a message and a movement that was started by activists against sexual abuse and harassment (in the U.S. first and then spread to many other countries).  That’s where the slogan, no means no, comes from. It’s not something Soojit invented per se."
399 days and people are still crying over Animal.,"Really, well calculated 😝"
They hate on movies like animal..but movies like four shots..who demean men and says it's okay to cheat on them is fine for them...pink deserves all the praise cause it's a good movie...but bringing only animal shows your true intention,Four shots is trolled too. It's the poster child of Toxic Feminism.
Cheese DELUXE sandwich,"😂😂😂😭😭😭 and the fact that he loves something so specific, named like this too"
Bipasha is so otherworldly beautiful. Like a Greek goddess. No one in the industry is prettier than her.,Beauty does indeed lie in the eyes of the beholder.
"2 nepo kids, one model who can’t act, and one one trick pony. Kyaa golden era?",Kareena is a good actor though imo
Wtf is cheese deluxe sandwich supposed to be,Imagine this on an expressway driving in the same order at a speed of 100 kmph\n1. Multi axle super deluxe bus\n2. Lorry carrying parmasen cheese \n3. Another identical Multi axle super deluxe bus \n\nSuddenly the first bus encounters an auto travelling at 15 kmph with drrrr sound. The first bus hits sudden brakes to its absolute extent. The cheese lorry and the following bus doesn’t have an option but to follow suit. That’s how you get Cheese deluxe sandwich in its truest form.
Possibly the worst acting ever witnessed,What about Main Prem Ki Deewani Hu? 😂

Urmila's character had a horrible ending in the movie..she deserved Anil and his children a lot more than Sridevi's greedy character. Sridevi signed the deal and she paid..she was at no fault.,"Also, Urmila’s character got pregnant at the end. So unfair for her child"

Will the audience accept this kinda story now?,In Indian TV serials !!!
i hope people workingat maddock were well paid,"Unfortunately, they were probably not. A massive part of the budget is fees charged by the stars and whatever crumbs left are distributed to the rest"
"Alongwith content, production houses need to reign in the budgets. Some movies do not require a huge budget. Stars' payments need to have some kind of capping or they can have a base pay (not saying it should be too low but definitely not 70 cr+) and rest profit sharing.",High Star payments just seem to be a money laundering scheme
"Dinesh Vijan has the smarts. If anyone looks at the content he and Saif made together under the Illuminati Films Banner, it makes sense why maddock films is so profitable. It's not that they don't make bad films but he's smart enough to dump it on OTT and still make a moolah. Also he has a great ear for music.",Wish those two hadn't broken up though
"The star model on which Bollywood has coasted for years, is on its way out. Once the Khans are done,it's more or less over.  Producers have always wanted 'assured returns' on horrible films by casting stars in them. They don't want to invest in writers , pay peanuts to technicians. I don't know how Maddock is operating, but you can see interesting writing and innovative concepts in their movies.","It's simple yet complicated thing - make everyone happy. There are so many kind of audiences, some just want to chill back and relax, some want comedy, some want romance, some want just masala, and some people do care about story and cinema. Maddock has invested in all of these areas equally. They don't want to provide cinematic masterpiece in a way that it becomes definition of art, they want to provide cinematic masterpiece in a way that it becomes definition of how an art can earn."
Adi Chopra and KJo are relics of the past. \nThey are not innovative as producers. In fact I would say they are holding the industry back with the type of content they choose to produce. \n\nCompare with the movies made by other producers and across all industries in India. \n\nThese guys just have a great grip on PR to keep their movies and actors in news.,"You forgot Nadiadwala Grandsons Entertainment, Tips Industries & T-Series (as movie producers)"
"As long as they don’t get bought by a big multimedia company like Reliance Jio, just like UTV, also known for their content driven movies got acquired by Disney.",Most maddock movies are co-produced by JioStudios.
"Indian movies need a good plot, good CJI and actors who can connect with the character.. \nWe don't need  car blasts, Superman in 144p, smoking hot girls.. Even I will even say cut the item songs also..","Also, stop hiring Overpaid Actors, instead invest that money into production quality."
mfw when i am in competition of making the most mid films possible and my rival is maddock,yeah but then you see that you're shit like Bade Miyan Chote Miyan and suddenly mid is modern Picasso.
Stree 2 made me realize that what was 100Cr 10 years back is now 500Cr.\n\n\nIf a good film comes around 500Cr is not a big number.,"No...even if you include 10 year inflation, it's not equivalent. If you go by basic footfalls. 3cr footfalls movie was 280-300cr grosser a in 2014-2015s, now a 3cr footfalls movie is 500cr grosser \n\nSo it's 300= 500 not 100=500\n\n\n\nApart from economics, other factors are at play here. We have very few movies which are opening 5cr+, even if they are of same quality as films doing 10cr+ opening 5 years ago. In general it is hard..really hard to score 100 nett unless it's a known ip or sequel. 500cr is only possible because people are not going for 10 movies they used to do in last 10 years, they are going for 1 or 2 movies. Even way lesser films are getting made for same reason."
"Prabhu deva is GOAT, no doubt in that, but it's so amazing how Hritik made the same choreography look finished and sharp. The way his body moves, it's so natural. It looks good on him.",INSTEAD of tiger hrithik action\nwe want hrithik prabhu deva dance combo
I have no idea about dance but everyone was awestruck when we saw Hrithik's moves in Dhoom 2. Also the Bang Bang title song too has some nice moves.,And the mini sequence in KNPH - Sitaron ki mehfil mein song
"Prabhu Deva, and many other choreographers like him (Ganesh Hedge, for example) have existed for very long, but it's only after Hrithik came onto the scene, and showed all the choreographers that he could actually do anything and everything they threw at him, that they got the courage to be really experimental with their choreoghapies. \n\nI saw a short clip of an interview of Farah Khan for Kaho Na Pyaar Hai's choreography. She was recollecting how she showed Hrithik the most complicated steps she could think of, as a prank, for his stage show scene, but instead of complaining, Hrithik simply went ahead and actually did the whole dance right there. All the choreographers were so dumbstruck that they had to go back home and come up with some better moves for him before returning on set the next day. That's what Hrithik did for the movies!\n\nDon't get me wrong, we have had good dancers before Hrithik too, such as Govinda, but none of them nearly were as stylish & aspirational as Hrithik was/is. Hrithik changed Indian cinema in more ways than one, with just his debut. And then he went ahead and completely blew our minds with his dance in Lakshya, Dhoom 2 and Bang Bang.\n\nAll due credit to Prabhu Deva for the choreography, but we wouldn't have ""Main Aisa Kyun Hoon"" without Hrithik!","I wouldn’t put Govinda in the same class as Hrithik. He had some fluidity and grace; but the main quality of his dancing was that he could “act” with his face while performing the steps. Similar to Madhuri Dixit or Sridevi among the women, they had extremely emotive faces and eyes that enhanced the dance performance. \n\nCompare that to your Tiger Shroffs and Varun Dhawans - they are extremely competent dancers but their facial expressions are totally flat.\n\nHrithik mixes the best of both worlds."
After Prabhu Deva \nHrithik is the Best Dancer in India.\nVery Unique Dance set by choreographer.,"The reason I rate hritik the highest is because of how is body is, he looks jacked but does is very fluidly, every step and his expressions are better. I know prabhu is just next level, but I enjoy watching hritik dance more then prabhu or any other actor, it's the attraction, charisma that hritik has."
Why is it that actors mimicking steps look much better than choreographers performing them?,"While teaching a teacher's main motive is to think and give the idea to the student how it's done then observe the student and improve it based on his observations,\n\nWhile a student has to perform it for his teacher under his guidance.\n\nThat's the difference you feel,\n\nPrabhu deva isn't there to perform but to create \n\nHrithik is there to perform what's been created and still in process."
Prabhu Deva ruined his own legacy by directing movies and he is one of the most terrible directors we have had in the history of Bollywood.,I came here to say the exact same thing
Dance top notch but expression Rohit wala.,Because this scene was meant to dhow him as a confused youngster in the movie
"I don't find this form of dance genre visually appealing or wanting to use these steps myself. \n\nIt seems asymmetric and anything going anywhere. To provide an analogy, it's dance equivalent of modern/abstract art. The only part that made sense was choreographed walking with the gun which was also caricatured, but this suited the movie segment.\n\nDance should have meaning and convey it. Jumping, wriggling or putting otherwise brilliant steps into songs that don't require that- are a no",You have myopia in dance. That song and it's dance was amazing and fit the context of the song.
I said this before; new BMCM completely missed the theme of the original (Bad boys). It was an action comedy movie.. not an out n out action movie. And Action looks so generic in new movie.,Tiger bachcha ko waise bhi comedy jamti nahin.
"Govinda was a very talented actor, it's sad seeing how he is now.",Lack of professionalism combined with superstitious beliefs.
Matar halwaai 🤣,"I googled ""mutton halwai"" and it exists apparently."
This is lifted from an old MGR movie. Engal Veetu Pillai .,Possibly. Another user mentioned Ram Aur Shyam which was a remake of Ramudu Bheemudu / Enga Veetu Pillai.
Aaju baaju baithe the kader Khan ko dikhe kaise nahi 🫡,"Usually this is just put down to suspension of disbelief.

"Most people keep talking and riding high horses on reddit groups about supporting good movies and boycotting bad movies. But in reality 99% of those people don't go watch these movies in theater. When I went to watch KILL, there was literally 10 people in the entire theater. Most people here just like to blabber and try to look oh so elite with all their bollywood movie criticism but when coming to support good movies like KILL -- you won't find them in theater. They would wait for a movie to come to OTT and then again spread their gyaan.","I was so pissed it didn't come out in my country, I was hyped. I'd fixed a free Sunday to go and then I come to learn it won't get a release. Used to be not just Dharma but the most obscure of Hindi films with lesser stars would come to our theatres but not anymore. \n\nSo it isn't just about looking elite on reddit, accessibility is an issue especially when the main source of audiences would rather prop up crap then such film, such films won't get wide international releases or even locally."
Profit hua hai approx 10 cr with 40 cr budget Kalki ke sath clash tha agar clash nhi hota pakka aur kama leti,"Theatrical release me kuch khas profit nahi hua in fact it had loss in theaters unfortunately .\n    \nIt's budget was 40cr and the world wide gross was 47 cr. And gross collections are not the real money they made this doesn't include the share theaters keep .      \nIt only returned money from OTT rights, DVDs and selling those remake rights to Chad ."
Until unless movies like BB3 & Singham Again started getting flop,Absolutely agree bro... Was about to write this... Until and unless this dumb movies with zero potential in any section hits in box office movies like kill etc will always suffer losses....
"The marketing was bad, nothing unique or creative if people mock or criticize Animal, so they should also examine its marketing. Its marketing was insanely great!!",Budget was also a factor. So was the Starcast. Animal literally had this generations most popular actor as its lead. \n\n\nKill was probably made on half of ranbir's salary for animal.
"This is a hollywood like movie with no 'bollywood masala""  such as item song, romantic comedy dialogues, guy punching another guy and he goes flying through walls kinda scenes, etc. No wonder why John Wick franchise bought its rights",Did they for real? Wow that's a proud moment for Kill

"Although there were flaws, this movie definitely deserved 100cr+","Yes I personally didnt like the movie that much and thought it was just OK, but then I remembered the shitty movies that have been released in recent years and earning hundres of crores...."
"Love part was dogshit  , action was amazing ...don't know how army guy has a beard","Love part did not bring the movie down though, their chemistry was fantastic and it was important so we care about what happens."
Shradas acting looks terrible here,She isnt even a good actress and if you put her across ranbir she is gonna get cooked
"Shraddha dress,hair,acting everything is so bad in this scene like wtf is that curtain type viel..","My first thought on seeing this, lmao. Is the styling supposed to be bad on purpose?"
So basically Ranbir was practicing his Character for Animal,"I mean he was right at first, u cant just take a job halfway across the country and literally not tell the person u r about to marry. Guess the makers realized it and they were like lets make ranbir say some sexist dialogues so that the audience knows who is wrong. Irl, all squabbles are grey."
Why aren't they blinking ????,That’s the director’s style ig
Is it me or all the luv ranjan movie characters talk in a same tone in their movies,"It's not you. For whatever creative reason, most of the male leads in his movies talk in a similar ''Bina break ki gaari'' tone LOL. I even remember Ranbir saying it in some show or interview that he had to practice this shit a lot 😂. And there's also that Dehli accent I think? Not the typical exaggerated and cheesy one but maybe the more subtle one.\n\nNot really sure on the female characters though, because in most of his movies I've noticed female characters are portrayed as the ''problem'' so they're maybe written and played in a way that you find it annoying lol."
"Usually we don't notice how bad of an actor shraddha is , but when she plays opposite to actually good actors its quite evident. Here, her acting was absolute 💩",A better actress would have elevated the movie despite the clunky concept and writing.
The good thing about this scene is he was just pretending to be regressive! It was all intentional since shraddha’s character wanted to break up the marriage but couldn’t hence he did it. The “main todd raha hun” at last. Damn.,So he was pretending to be like this? And why couldn't shraddha break it off herself? I'm curious and not to the point of watching it lol 😁
Ranbir always cooks. He's an excellent actor.,"It’s in his blood , literally."
"Honestly he has a point. She should have told him first. He has a valid concern about her moving. But his ideology is very flawed here, saying that she doesn’t need to work.",He specifically said those things so they can break up. It's the plot of the movie.
"So many feminists still misinterpret this scene. He is faking to do the breakup and make himself look bad, like Shraddha wants, she literally goes behind his back to hire to make the breakup happen because she’s too chicken to do it herself and doesn’t want to look bad. Shraddhas character was the ultimate red flag in this movie and towards the end when she gaslights and tries to say “you played me” this is what the world is right now with women. No accountability of their own mistakes. Say whatever you want about Ranbir’s family being too overbearing, I don’t disagree, but Shraddha was not a saint in this movie.","You are the one misinterpreting what they are saying. Its not like the whole movie is posted here, only this particular scene is posted and they commenting on what he said or what kind of thinking he portrayed in this particular scene. Its not labelling him as a red flag in the whole movie, its just showing how goodhis acting was in this scene to make him look bad as it was supposedd to. On youtube or anywhere you see this scene there are same feminist comments and the ones correcting them, I am not saying its bad to let them know the context but most of the people commenting here have watched the movie or atleast know the plot. They are just commenting against the regressive shitty mentality this society has for the women working. No offense its just my opinion."
Man I love this scene. They perfectly replicated friendly banter that happens around the group all the time,"Old friends from school/ college, the best group."
Easily one of my favorite comfort movies of all time. Having a hard day? Put it and relax. Having a good day? Put it on and enjoy. You can watch it any time and enjoy.,It's the kind of film that grows on you. Relatable characters.
Why did Farhan stop acting?,Saw him in Toofan. \nAnd today in a swiggy ad with Shibani Dandekar.

Man i wish i saw this in the cinema.. i was 12 i think at that time,I did fortunately watch it in the theater and it was just amazing. We were 3 friends back then who went for this movie and still are. Good times!
Where are those days when movies me araam se beer peete hue chill maarte hue logo ko dikhaya jaata tha,Now they started making 4 more shots please😂

Never works irl,Those who have that poker face and always win in bluffing games in cards manage to get secrets out. \n\nDialogues may be different but the 'serious look' works 😁
"Because old movies used to look like they are shot in real locations and the leads are standing in between the real crowd. We used to feel relatable watching them roaming on random sets and streets and thats how they felt more beautiful but now modern movies completely ruined the realism.  Every thing looks fake the sets, the crowd, the cloths and this is the reason why majority of people dont relate to Bollywood any more.",Agreed. Esp when looking at the big hits recently including 12th fail and lapataa ladies… they had that real feeling without looking like some glamour small town.. people could relate to the story as a result.
They look.\n\n would call it innocence.not beautiful,I would call it magic ✨
"Makers lost the sense of making good cinema. Either they are cringing or making a bland cinema.\n\nHowever, Laapata Ladies and Three Of Us successfully gave us the same feeling of the lost era.",I also feel like earlier music used to play a huge part in movies and the songs would actually hype up the movie. But now the music is so generic and adds no value to the movies. The quality has dropped substantially
,"Loved this movie, her apartment & this pair. Iktara song is just 🤌🏻❤️‍🔥"
"ISTG now its all about glamour, unnecessary drama and lewd item songs. The only directors who put efforts in the cinematography are Sanjay Leela Bansali and Imtiaz Ali.","I think all these elements were present in the industry from the start and on a greater scale so that is not the problem because they are necessary, the real problem is how they present them to the audience."
"This post is the literal compilation of some of my favourite movies!! Barfi, Ranjhana, Saathiya, Swades, Rang de Basanti, Hasee toh Phasee, Queen, Aaja Nachle, Taare Zameen Par, Ghajini❤️",Do you know what movie the 6th picture is from?
What's Ranjhana doing between such wholesome movies😭\n\n,Shit movie but visually stunning
"Dude you are attaching your feelings when you saw those then to the memories, you are not gonna get those when you watch it in the moment",i think OP more so means the visuals & color direction aren’t as raw & beautiful anymore 😭
Because you're a nostalgia merchant stuck in the past,Maybe cause most of the new films sucks
One word - eyebrows.\n\nFake eyebrows have ruined the look .\nThen fake facts and ultra toned plastic body.\n\nFake dresses.,Hairs too. I want 90s hairs to make a comeback
I find few scenes in this movie very difficult to watch. \nGlad it got made.,Kudos to Aamir Khan and everyone involved with this movie. People in India (and many other countries) just don't want to talk about disabilities and mental health. Movies like this hopefully helps people to open up and talk about these conditions.
Nostalgia - Those timed phone calls you get to make when you are in hostel.,My mom tells me about those. I’m privileged with internet.
"Anyone having a nerdy padhaku elder brother can relate to this scene somewhat, Indian parents just make everything about the studious kid lol.",The brother himself was very gentle with Ishaan though. I liked that.
still one of the greatest movies of all time,Definitely. It's one movie after 3 idiots that I recommend when non-Indians ask me for Bollywood recommendations.
"Whole movie is so good. Shows how good Aamir is as director. I am sure he ghost directs quite a lot, that is why his projects always shine.",Amol Gupte crying in the corner.
"Sadly there are no more masterpieces like this, these days.","I honesly feel Secret Superstar is underrated, but is definitely not as good as this."
Schools and specially boarding schools are nothing but center to traumatize children for their lifetime.,So true. And it’s also such a norm in our culture to send kids off to these places thinking that that’s enough for their upbringing and well-being. Neglected and tortured in school and at home.
"Whole movie is so good. Shows how good Aamir is as director. I am sure he ghost directs quite a lot, that is why his projects always shine.",I’ve always wondered why Aamir hasn’t directed more…
My BIL is in his country’s armed forces. He cried like a baby at these scenes.,"Toh bhai yeh kya logic?\n\n\nEdit- I mean, Fauji rote nahi? Ofc they do"
such great acting by a child can't believe this happens in real life,Him and Munni in Bajrangi Bhaijaan were best child actors I’ve seen for their age group.
Bhai 3 baje dekh rhaa hoon raat mein and it legit scared the shit outta me,Bhai bhari dopahar mein dekh raha hoon.. Fatt gayi..
This is the first time I am seeing this and it scared me. Like some disclaimer could have worked or some warning.,"Same, first time. I was wondering some funny scene or something.but so creepy and what is that sound. It's daytime and still damn man."
"Bro you should have put NSFW or some disclaimer. Was just  about to sleep and damn this is next level crazy scary🙄\n\nOn another note, Urmila should be back on the big screen. This is giving literal chills.","Old horrors movie had that 'something' man, the scenes & acting created an atmosphere 100 times more terrifying than today's cheap VFX jumpscares."
"As beautiful and sensual she was in songs and as an actress, her psycho horror roles hit very different. \n\nBhoot, Pyar Tune Kya Kiya iirc and then Kaun. Imo best works of her filmography",Puar tune kya kia was excellent..Urmila was simply too good
Her acting was amazing in this scene. \n\nEven without any context for the scene (which makes it scarier if you've seen the movie) it's legit scary. The sound effect amplifies the scare Factor,I haven't seen the movie and you're right it still freakss me out. That giant grin and the expression with that music...brrrrr. \n\nWhat is the context though?? If you remember
"if you watched the movie, then who could have killed the cat after intermission??",This. Have always wondered. \nI always thought it was the thief
Is this movie streaming on any platform ?,You can see it free on youtube as of now
Nipar wo kar kya Rahi hai?sax sux aa gaya uski dimag me since sahib isn't home?,"Bhrata, Alt balaji se bahar aaiye."
Someone explain this scene plz,She is a serial killer in this movie
Movie name?,"Kaun(1999), it is on YouTube but it will show the year as 2016 which is wrong of course."
"I thought yeh toh shayad easy hai, then mene mobile rkha and acting krne ki koshish kri. Now I understand lol..","Yeah, only a few people can do it naturally. Most need a lot of training."
"Meanwhile Ananya Panday with that 1 wide-eyed expression: ""Oh my god yaaaa, vo ladka nikal gaya guysssss""",This could easily be Sonam also
I wish he is not typecasted in small town roles. Man is full of potential and skill.,"My favorite role of his still remains the one in Ludo, an underrated gem"
arjun kapoor laughing in the corner with ananya pandey,And Jahnvi Kapoor is *feeling shy*
More acting in 27 second clip than Sonam Kapoor has done in her whole life.,"Not a fan of hers, but have you seen Neerja? She actually acted well in that"
"You can't be an actor if your born in an acting family, half of the nepo kids can't even act to save their lives. What Rajkumar Rao does on the big screen is bring life to the character he plays. he is one of those diamonds in a industry full of coal.",Ranbir Kapoor and alia:🗿🗿
Not very good. Just okay.,"You're not wrong it's just that the general batch of actors is so bad that he seems far, far better in comparison."
He's got such a punchable face,And you have got a punchable personality. Trust me.
Ye kis chutiye insaan ne background music daal ke is scene ki beizzati ki hai?,"sahi main, it hits much much harder"
"Anand one of the best movies produced by Bollywood, i cried ugly in the end","Watched it with my gf, I was sobbing like a pig on her lap at the end"
"This one was also by Hrishikesh Mukherjee? Seriously, I can not stop appreciating Hrishi da's cinema. Life of ordinary people in the most wholesome ways. Respect!",Seriously - evergreen cinema.. his movies and Sunday afternoon.. best combination
incapsulates Stoics’ philosophy about death. Have read similar arguments by Seneca when trying to console a mother whose son died young.\n\nI wish he should have delivered these heavy dialogues a little more slowly.,"Saying it normally made them feel like things we talk day to day. That's what the director was going for, I think. Death or end of life has become a forgone conclusion for him that it no longer fits in the heavy category."
I am perhaps the only who feels Rajesh Khanna would have killed it as Vijay Varma in Deewar(1975).,Yesssssss killed it!!! Both him and Bachchan are legends. RK plays drunk people the most realistic way ever. He would have killed it in Sharaabi too. My legend! May his soul RIP.
Ye 2 line ki baat ko itna ghumane ke kya zaroorat thi..... 😒.,jab seedhe si baat samajh na aaye tab baat ghuma phiraa ke batani padti hai babumoshai
This is the one and only movie which brought tears to my eyes.,Watch The Green Mile
I came to Bombay in 2021. Spent three years studying acting. I started auditioning but haven’t cracked anything good yet. I have lost out on projects at the last moment because of one reason or the other. Most common one being they require somebody known. I feel demotivated because of all of this. What would your advice be to someone like me? How do I wake up everyday with the same level of zest to make it?,"I empathize with the hardships that you have been going through but I believe why should life be easy, I see so many people around me working hard not only in our fields but in so many other areas. The ultimate idea is to not give up, because giving up is not a choice. It took me 3 years of sleeping on the platforms, being a homeless person but I never gave up. Also working hard is equally important."
Hair care tips sir,"It’s simple, all you need is a razor or laser surgery"
Sir in most of your interviews the one movie that always gets mentioned is “Saransh”. It’s definitely one of your best works. But can you suggest some movies of yourself which you feel was very intense in terms of acting and the character building so that the people can watch and enjoy/embrace.,"Daddy, Maine Gandhi ko Nahin Maara, The Signature, Vijay 69."
You've acted in many hollywood movies. What do you think hollywood can learn from bollywood and vice versa?,"I think we are almost reaching the level of professionalism that they have. Everybody is trained in their field, even in the smallest of roles, which we are in the process of learning, more professionalism and accountability. What they can learn is how to make so called unbelievable situations, believable and convince 1.4 billion people."
Can we see Anupam Kher acting in Marathi movie?,"I've already done a Marathi film and I will be very happy to do another one, the one I have done is Kashala Udyachi Baat with Sachin Khedekar."
"Not a Question but,\nI really miss your show ""Anupam Uncle"", those were the days💖\nSir how industry has changed from then to now ?","I also miss the show too, it brought out the child in me. I would like to do a different version of that show again, with children being completely different than what they were 30 years back, I am sure with all the gadgets etc we give to children they still retain innocence somewhere. Thank God for it."
Dint know you were in Silver lining playbook.. \nhow do you make acting look so natural,"Thanks for the compliment. It's my job to be good and i'm a trained actor, and we are working with the likes of Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and David O Russell as a director, one better be brilliant."
Welcome to Reddit Anupam ji and congratulations for 40 glorious years\n\nWould Actor prepares Award concentrate on new talent or cover entire range of talents,"Thank you for your question. Since it's an award instituted by my acting school actor prepares, there will be various categories related to acting with an international jury, including best debut and it will be an international award not only for Indian films but films from all over the world."
Which is the most difficult role for you to play till date?,"There are various types of difficulties one faces as an actor, as they keep changing over a period of time. Like the difficulty is very different when I'm doing an english language series or film, I find it difficult because I think in my mother tongue which is Hindi. Also I try my level best not be just competent, because I believe, competence is the biggest enemy of brilliance."
Thank you for doing this. You're an incredible actor. Love you. \n\nQ: What kind of movies do you wish were made more n more?,"Thank you so much, thats very kind. I have loved my journey as an actor and I continue to do so. I have been one of those fortunate actors who has had the opportunity of doing so many different roles. I like human drama and comedies, I wish comedies were made more, i've not acted in a full fledged comedy for a long time, innocent comedies like Ram Lakhan, Shola Aur Shabnam, Dil Hain Ki Manta Nahin."
Akshay does not blend into roles and character. If the movie is based around his 1 type then good.\n\nArshad really looked and felt like a beat up broke lawyer in this. (I'm praising),Sangharsh aur janwar dekhi hai jyada kahe to sainik or bole to baby
agree 100%,How can someone nail a role in comedy and also serious movies. Arshad🤌
akshay can never portray an underdog effectively thats why this and other movies like this failed,"His onscreen presence is always too strong. Absolutely wasn’t fitting for Jolly LLB 2.\n\nWhich leads me to a question no one ever really answered. Why was it that Akshay couldn’t convince her to invest on him with the promise that her case would be the first case he would fight, and he would do everything in his power to succeed?\n\nWould’ve been much better and easier than not deceiving her right?"
"Akshay Kumar has been the one hijacking sequel role for a long while (Jolly LLB, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai off the top of my head) .\n\nHow the turn tables and all that.","The irony is he was actually good in Bhool Bhulaiya.\n\nThe powerful and influential(bollywood) always do this, like Kareena(Golmaal, Singham)."
I like both the movies but yeah 1 was definitely better mainly cause of Arshad and Boman.,"Yes, the top dog and underdog contrast dynamics were portrayed so well!"
"Yes  agree completely... Arshad was much better..... However, akshay  sells more tickets at bo... Hence they switched.... Didn't help. The collection s   tho.. Is another story..... Lolz",What are you saying??\nJolly LLB2 was a Super-hit film earning almost 190 Cr.
"You broke so many stereotypes in Indian cinema—if you were debuting in 2024, what kind of role would you pick to shake things up all over again ?","Good question. It's funny how life comes full circle. Satyam Shivam Sundaram shook society when it came out. And I think I'd again choose a story that's located in a rural setting for ""my 2024 debut"". Hindi films have become so heavily urbanised."
"Mam, when will you appear in movie again>>",Well I have a small but effective role in Bun Tikki which is yet to be released in India though its already premiered abroad. But you can catch me at my snootiest when The Royals releases on Netflix later this year.
Hello Ma'am !\nMy question is 'While watching the recent bollywood films have you ever felt that I would have nailed this role in my time?',"I don't know whether I would have nailed it, but I would have loved the chance to play Priyanka Chopra's character in Bajirao Mastani. It was a complex role that piqued my interest."
"Welcome to Reddit Zeenat Ji,\n\nIs there a movie/role that you regret doing in past?\n\nEnjoy your AMA here, you have huge fan following.","In all honesty, I regret doing Jaanwar. It took eight years to make and by the end of it we were just exhausted! It was absolutely tedious to shoot in bits and bobs over so many years."
Hi Zeenat Ji\n\nAs a kid I would always get confused between yourself and Parveen Babi. Did you ever get confused in public by fans?,"That was a very common mistake. Parveen was stunning so I didn't mind it either! There was one very awkward moment in Dubai when a woman went absolutely gaga over me thinking I'm Parveen, but this was AFTER her passing! It was so uncomfortable, and I was the one to have to break it to that dejected fan that her favourite actress is no more."
Ma'am you were such a bold actress back in the day. as a teenager now accoridng to me women in the 70s were the ones in the family who did not speak a word and had no autonomy. but after looking at ur work I stood corrected. how tough did u feel and did people support u for going bold,"I think the 70s were an interesting time and women were finding something of a voice both in the home and in the workplace. I didn't see myself as tough, but I also didn't see myself as a pushover, no matter what society or the media wanted to portray. There were many young women facing difficult times in the public eye at the time."
Please give tips on how to speak in a poised manner. The way you carry yourself is such an inspiration,Think about what it is that you want to say and express yourself only if you have an opinion.
Aap aaj ke generation ke kis actor ke saath kaam Krna pasnd krengi,"I recently had a wonderful time working with Ishaan Khatter. He is a thorough gentlemen, and his parents should be proud! But nobody else really jumps to mind as such."
"Hi Miss Aman! I don't expect a response but I was wondering what advice you would give to the next generation of Bollywood actresses today. Do you have any regrets in your career?\n\n  \nThank you for doing this. I'm only 17 but I've grown up watching your movies and have always admired your strength, grace, and beauty. All love!","The same advice I'd give any young professional - choose your priorities carefully, stay focused, be disciplined and persevere."
Ma'am can you please tell the difference of the industry now and during the 70's,I know people like to criticise the Hindi film industry and much of it is valid. But I think a major and positive improvement I see is that there are women at every rung of the process pulling their weight and claiming their place with competence. In my time it wasn't unusual to be the only woman on set! So this is a striking difference to me.
"i knew the stree 2 would be a super hit, but this is a shocker",Actually and seen a very nice movie after so long must say
Hopefully this ignites other media houses to make movies like this and not some random bs,Production companies now will think that stree 2 is hit because of cinematic universe not because of its a good movie and we see these Production houses churning out soul less wanna be cinematic universe
It has to keep going. The target is passing 644 cr,That wont happen. Jawan Telugu+ Tamil dub had pretty good collections.
Stree 2 is a very good film indeed but I think this movie could collect this much because it is a franchise movie... It had a cult fanbase and it transformed in huge numbers... I think other franchise movies will also perform on box-office but can't take the impact of stree 2 away,It is always said that sequels do better than other movies.  Something about 2's & 3's that get people in seats.
"Bhai stree me aur. Bhi log the , it was not a shraddha film while jawan was an srk film",This. I seriously doubt that stree would have been this successful if the side cast include Rajkumar Rao wasn't present.
"This goes on to show that the era of the superstar is going to be over soon.\n\nIn today's age of pan Indian movies & OTT, content is the new king.\n\nRegardless of budget, today's BW movies should have something fresh, right from script to technical aspects like editing, VFX, music & acting, plus they should be heavily marketed, thus guaranteeing audiences to theatres, leading to subsequent BO success.\n\nWish more movies like Stree 2 are successful in the coming years.","It is kind of easy to think that superstar system destroys cinema, but it actually keeps it alive.\n\nSuperstar system is over in Hollywood and its effects are clearly visible. Their business is torn apart, even movies with good stories are not able to bring audience to theaters.\n\nMalayalam Cinema does a really good job of mixing a star led system and simultaneously focusing on content too (the audience have to be a sport for that)"
"It’s such a injustice that Jana played by Abhishek Banerjee was reportedly only paid 55 lakhs.. he was one of the main reasons the movie was so good, he steals all the scenes everytime. I hope there’s some sort of bonus for him.",He really played the character well.
"Is it genuinely good? I’ve watched Stree 1 and liked it, but haven’t watched this one as I tend to stay away from Bollywood “gender equality” movies. Is it a preachy feminist type movie or is it actually good?","I haven't watched Stree 2 and only watched this because of the songs. It was a good movie, no, it is not a preachy feminist type."
"Happy for Shraddha Kapoor, btw SRK gave two big hits in a year. That's not joke.",Akshay Kumar in 2007 : \nHey Baby\nNamaste London\nBhool Bhulaiyaa\nWelcome
Vanga thinking about why he got left behind.,He has a different kind of an audience
Where is Kabir from dhoom ?,The most iconic Kabir in my humble opinion.
Missed me ?\n\n![gif](giphy|4rBKyy0iRTQEE),Thali for any season.
"So, It was Rhul, Raj in 90s and 2000s, then kabir and arjun in 2010s till now....","Now it’s going to be Aryaan, Vivaan, Ayaan, Ishaan, Farhaan and so on"
Except Kabir Singh 😅,Singlehandedly ruined the name Kabir for me😭
Kabir is quite an assertive name as well as has a sexy ring to it. Such names are used to create the larger than life aura for the actor. Maybe I am wrong but I feel like that.,you are not wrong. I feel the same
Ranbir Kapoor was the KABIRest of them Kabirs,He just Kabirs like no one else has ever Kabir'ed
no kabir singh? lmao the hate u guys give to those type of movies and characters is crazy...,"Because he was supposed to be hated only as he's not an ideal partner figure because he's toxic. He's just a gey shade protagonist that's it but here all the kabirs that are shown aren't, because they're non toxic, non abusive, someone who's perfect fit for a partner unlike criminal and abusive Kabir Singh"
You don't need to be a fan of anyone to appreciate an art. This movie is pure art,True! They don’t make these no more. \n\nLove Ileanna’s expressions throughout .
Why would you even change the BGM of this particular scene? The original BGM elevates his acting to next level.,Most probably taken from Instagram where they post with different BG to avoid copyright strike.
His pain 🥺🥺🥺🥺\n\nAnd people still have the audacity to say he doesn't have much range.,The emotions in this scene were🫶🏼
"Ileana don't get due for her performance in Barfi, both RK and PC had huge scope with characterization itself but Ileana's character didn't have much scope yet she pulled on par with others in the movie",i had huge hopes for her after watching this film. but she kinda just went downhill after this.
"I am neither a fan of Ranbeer or Priyanka. But Barfi, loved every single second of this movie, loved both of their acting","For sure, their best performances!"
I used to hate romcoms and especially Shahrukh Khan movies. My favourite actor was Hrithik Roshan for Dhoom 2 and Krrish. Watched Barfi and it became my favourite movie and Ranbir  my favourite actor.,You still hate srk movies?
"Acting peaked here? Lol. \n\nThis is obviously a PR post, but if you really want to see good physical acting in such emotional scenarios, go watch Kamal Hasan in Sadma.",User name checks out 😁
"A film was planned a few years ago, but from what I've read, I think her husband reportedly refused to sell the rights to production companies for this biopic.\n\nSo filmmakers don't have much of a choice, unless they decide to make a film on 'Vandana Sharma' and then get into legal trouble. But I agree that her story is inspiring and can produce a really great biopic, if done properly","Oh interesting. It's rare that the kith and kin refuse such a request. Good for them, probably they don't want it messed up or to commercialise her tragedy."
"I grew up near Ames and met her a few times, she was so kind to me. I can’t put into words how inspirational it was as a 7 year old brown girl obsessed with space to see someone who looked like me in the field. I hope if a film is made it does her the justice she deserves.",Didn’t she dissociate herself from her Indian identity and said she has been and will always be an American?
"I honestly hope if we ever get one, it’s Hollywood led.\n\nIn recent years, biopics out of Bollywood are just mediocre with a lot of drama and twisting of facts under the guise of creative freedom",The man who knew infinity movie was good because it was made by a Hollywood director.
Unrelated (but not really) but the university I went to in U.S. has a student housing building named after her. It’s called the Chawla Hall. 😊,is it the kalpana chawla hall at UT Arlington?
Early 2000s there was some buzz about a movie being made on her accomplished life and Priyanka Chopra had been approached. I guess the rights werent sold.,"hi! I saw you on reddit sharing a link of deleted scene of boom 2003 movie on YouTube, which is renowned now from YouTube, do you have that deleted scene or video , if so pls provide me link"
I don't want a movie I want a documentary on her story. That would be good. I don't trust Bollywood with space related projects after Mission Mangal 🫣. Well Rocketry was good if they make a movie like that,A docu drama might be better than a movie.
He has stolen the show in many of his movies tbh..,"True, he's one of the best actor we have in our country rn. Wish him the best for his future films."
"Recently watched it again , Ayushman was the bully and unlikable character in the movie. He didn't deserve happy ending.","definitely. he acted horrible the whole movie then cried in the rain for 5 minutes and expected to be forgiven. I was rooting for kriti and rkr the whole time, the scene where she calls him out for faking and gets to know the real him is so sweet!"
This was my favorite scene ever! I wish I had this confidence!!,>  I wish I had this confidence!!\n\nReal life mein dhulai ho jaayegi.\n\nAll alone and being condescending/insulting to a bunch of rough looking guys who are already very pissed off with you.\n\nYeeeah... this only happens in movies.\n\nThe only way to behave like this in real life is if he were in police uniform.
Apparently the auto wala coming into the scene wasn't planned and was an improv? Based on one of his interviews!!,Really?? What the hell GOAT!
This entire film has a separate fan base. There should be a TMK Fan Club. All 7 of us should meet once a year.,"bhaisahab din bana diya aapne hamara 😆😆, sabse dirty secret hai hamari life ka ki poori film chahe jaisi ho i LOVED akshay khanna in it...."
This is one of very few sarcastic movies which were made in India. I think India is still not ready for this kind of genre.,Yes this whole scene is sarcasm but people are thinking it as bad acting
Katrina could have done comedy well. Sadly she’s too pretty to be just considered funny. Pretty privilege cuts both ways,"bollywood also has like no female-centric comedy movies, regardless of how pretty they are. even in Welcome Katrina just sits to the side and the gags are mostly the guys' responsibility."
"The times when you could dare to ""disrespect"" Bharat Mata without vandalism, death threats, boycotts and bans. \n\nKaha gaye vo din 🤧",You're goddamn right. Today they'll even dissect this scene and call it look how they making mockery of our country.
this is a remake of 60s italian/hwd movie scene to scene .. there’s a reason why it’s ridiculed,"Your first statement is indeed true but that is not the reason why it is ridiculed. Most people are either not aware or don't care about the utter lack of originality. It is due to the ""chalta hai"" attitude of Indians that has plagued India ever since zero was discovered."
Guys where can you watch Tees Maar Khan in 720p or 1080p? cause I couldn't find anywhere to watch it in good quality.,"none of the ott platforms ig, YouTube prolly"
SRK and Irffan in a frame is wholesome. Kudos to SRK for not having starry airs or insecurity to be in a short role in this film - that's what appeals him to many. Both great guys and good examples for people. \n\nHow I miss Irrfan!,"Thiss!!! Actors like SRK And Irfan understand the depth of the role and that acting is acting, small or big role doesn’t matter. You can shine even in a 2 min appearance \nAnd yesterday I heard govindas wife saying— how dare they offer chunninbabus (devdas) role to govinda.. main hoti tou gaali deke Bhaga deti.. himmat kaise hui usko itna chota role dene ki"
"I thought that SRK will suck in front of Irrfan, but I was wrong. He was able to hold. What an amazing movie!","""He was able to hold"" LMAO do you know who you're talking about!? I'm actually crying from laughter XD"
"Comparison is a thief of joy. They’re both great actors in their own way. Just glad we could witness them together on big screen. The movie was a bit dragged, but they both peaked during climax.","""Don't always keep looking for Better, sometimes, it destroys Good"" - SRK"
Thank you Priyadarshan for giving us this scene. We will always know that Irrfan is a better actor but SRK also holding his own,OMG it was made by Priyadarshan 😱. I was thinking 🤔 like when srk and Priyadarshan will work together.
Beautiful adaptation of Krishna and Sudama friendship..\n\nSRK's speech at the end was lovely,I still get emotional watching the speech at the school about lost friendship.
Also watch the original Malayalam version. Mammootty peaked,Lmfao this is not his peak. He is a great actor and this is a nice movie but not his best any sense.
What’s the background song called? I know it’s the same tune as “Ik Taara” but the lyrics are different. Help please?,"This is the male version of iktara song, you should be able to find it on YouTube"
Imo Irrfan outperformed SRK in this. Loved it,Man it is irrfan he will outperform almost every actor to have ever lived in the world
Inspired from sudama and shri Krishna friend ship.,Copied scene for scene from a mallu movie. Not inspired from anything.
Lmao. our censorship laws and cancel culture is the biggest joke,"Well you making a film even on this ""joke"" might get you cancelled 😂"
Do it and land behind bars.,Bars!!? He'd be lynched to death by people of every single religion. Like saare dharm milke power rangers team up karenge director pe
Yes ...the answer is ALADEEN.\n\n(positive or negative)\n\nPublic can decide !!!!!!!!!,"Well, this gives me Aladeen hope for the future"
"I don't understand how the fuck have we regressed so much as a country and how the fuck we feel less and less free to express ourselves in today's time shouldn't this be reverse, and no we can't in this climate we can't do anything just look at latent folks it's so dumb that my can't even comprehend that there are FIR on ppl for making stupid unoriginal joke","Wdym ""regressed"" ?  When did we or were we so progressive to actually regress? \n\nIndia has always been like this, even satyajit ray lamented about this during his time"
google 'Latent' and find out,Latent tha kya waise I don’t think matlab dictator level jitna satirical raha hoga
"In today's environment, never!!","Anytime in this nations history, it's not possible."
Forget this. Even a film like Rang De Basanti or My Name is Khan is impossible today. We already saw that a few jokes on a YouTube channel were enough for the entire government machinery to hunt down some comedians. That’s what the political environment has been reduced to since 2014.,"Rang De Basanti  itself struggled little bit at that time, but was allowed with few cuts & special screening to military leadership.\n\nMy Name is Khan - You would loose all your money. Although Karan produced My Name is Khan & Kurbaan & New York by Adi in short span of time so my tinfoil hat says chances are all these were funded by somebody."
"In a country where the biggest grossers are films like animal and KGF you expect this, OP?","Add Jawan and Pushpas too, the brainrot blockbuster list will be complete."
We have PK. That is more daring to pull off in our society.,It was over a decade ago
Have you watched Badass Ravikumar?,Best Indian film of this year and probably will be. Only satire is honest cinema.
character acting at its excellence 🙌🏻\n\nand everything about this scene is so good\nespecially that camera movement,which movie is this?
"This role is his magnum opus, whatever people say. But he does 10 shitty films after a great film.",Not as an actor tho. I think he has given amazing performances. The story writing and screenplay might have been bad
 is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare—and the film’s biggest triumph is that the characters are defined by reality. Power-packed performance of Shahid Kapoor makes this movie an epitome of talent showcase apart from the brilliant star cast. This is for the first time in Shahid’s career where you get to see glimpses of Pankaj Kapur in his acting.,"Yeah! I remember Pankaj Kapoor's famous line from office office ""excuse me! Ek form dijiye mujhe account kholna hai"""
"His acting in Kaminey , Haider and Udta Punjab . Those 3 will be what he will be remembered for..\n\nWhat an acting performance..\n\nBut then he has a nasty habit of doing 1 insane movie followed by 5 extreme dirt bad steaming pile of shit movies.\n\nI remember after watching Kaminey, I declared him the filmfare awards winner of that year..  I was waiting for award seasons just to see him sweeping all the awards.. but of course this is India. Never gonna happen.",And Kabir Singh !!!
"As great as Shahid was, Tabu and Kay Kay stole the show for me. Such a gem of a film.",Kay Kay is effortless and Tabu is natural. Shahid was giving it all out in this movie.
I was so naive. Never understood that he was calling India as the dacoit in this story. He meant that India forcefully got Kashmir accession by pointing a gun at Raja Hari Singh. \n\nI hope this movie will get re-released in theatres. It would be even more beautiful if it's re-released after India gains control of Gilgit and Baltistan sometime in the next 2-3 years. Glorious.,He's calling out both Pakistan and India. Implying neither care what kashmiris want. \n\nTruth is real chutzpah was played by Raja Hari Singh. That buffoon only acceded J and K after Pakistani militas entered. He had no way to defend against them so joined india. The region which lies in Pakistan's side is because of this.
Let’s be honest. This movie belongs to Tabu in and out.,You can say that about most of the movies in which she acts..
Propaganda movie that demonises Indian Army,the army is not moral. they've raped women and killed children in the valley. defend right where it is right and stop whitewashing crimes
Movie plot showed the plight of kashmir,"look at the downvotes lol, they cant accept facts"
"But at his best , he got mogged by Ranveer Singh in Padmavaat.",It would have been something if Rawal Ratan Singh was a nicely written character. In Padmavat his character was nothing more than a cardboard cut out. And Ranveer got a nicely written character. So he performed and killed it. \n\nHad Shahid gotten little something in writing he would have crushed it too.
All Gangs of Wasseypur alumni !,This should be the top voted comment. Absolutely correct.
Pankaj tripathi in omkara,Pankaj Tripathi in Run
"I recognised Shahid in Dil to pagal hai , recently watched it in theatre.",He was in Taal before that
"Recently watched Highway (2014) again, after making a post for its 10th anniversary\n\nImmediately noticed that Saharsh Kumar Shukla (Bewda from Chichhore) and Durgesh Kumar (the actor who went famous for saying ""Dekh raha hai Binod?"" in Panchayat) were also part of the kidnapping gang.","Omg dekh raha hai Binod was the man who was being nice to Aliya among the kidnappers ! Wow, this man is brilliant. I could not stand the character in panchayat but he was all cute and nice in highway hahaha"
gajraj rao in dil se,also tigmanshu dhulia ina blink and miss scene (intro rain scene)
Wamiqa in jab we met,Wait what? Can you remind me what's her character?
1. (Master) Mehmood in Kismat\n2. Sanjeev Kumar in Hum Hindustani\n3. Jaya Bhaduri (Bachchan) in Mahanagar\n4. Subhash Ghai in Aradhana\n5. (Master) Aamir Khan in Yaadon Ki Baaraat\n6. Mithun Chakraborty in Do Anjaane\n7. Shekhar Kapur in Ishq Ishq Ishq\n8. (Master) Bobby Deol in Dharam Veer\n9. Farah Khan in Saat Saal Baad\n10. Irrfan in Salaam Bombay\n11. Akshay Kumar in Aaj\n12. Zoya Akhtar in Kamasutra\n13. Manoj Bajpayee in Bandit Queen\n14. Karan Johar in DDLJ\n15. Shahid Kapur in Taal\n16. Rajpal Yadav in Shool\n17. Nawaaz in Sarfarosh\n18. Alia Bhatt in Sangharsh\n19. Pankaj Tripathi in Run\n20. Sushant Singh Rajput in Dhoom 2,SSR in Dhoom 2? Where?
Two movies for me.\n\n1. Gajini. Never realised Sunil Grover was in it. Didn't even realize on second and third viewings\n\n\n2. Talaash. Was absolutely staggered to discover Rajkumar Rao in a side role on a re-watch several years after the movie came out.,I was searching for this comment. I was shocked too seeing Sunil Grover in gajini.
Sushant singh Rajput in A certain serial before pavitra rishta can't remember the name of that soap,Kis des mien hai mera fail. Harshad was the lead
"Many from Bharat Ek Khoj, a show from the late 80s. Irrfan Khan, Tom Alter, Lucky Ali, Piyush Mishra",Was lucky ali a monk in it?
Bulleya was such a masterpiece to depict that tbh,honestly such lovely and well written lyrics
there's Pritam's Bulleya and Irshad Kamil's Bulleya and Anushka is there in both,"That’s a weird way to say that, either say Pritam and Vishal Shekhar or Amitabh Bhattacharya and Irshad Kamil😅"
Actor Salman Khan peaked here. That subtle look of heartbreak and loss of hope 😭,"And moment comes at very beginning of the film, sets up strong impact on rest of the story"
This movie was the last film where salman acted his heart out 😞,I’d say he last tried in Bharat.
Most underrated Vishal Shekhar song ever ...,Papon ne gaya hai
And later she admitted that she also used to go to the mosque because she knew he would be there,Toh itna naatak kyun.. \nGussa chor patchup kar aur khatam kar na\n\nBacha toh phir se bhi paida kar sakte. \n\nVlimax mein bacha hua bhi phir se\nAisa hi time waste kiya husband ko tang kar ke
Dude I did the same for a girl and her friend called me a stalker...Just waited outside her school so far away that she couldn't notice..just to catch a glimpse of her. Been 2 years and still love her![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man),Secret Admirer bhi aaj kal  Aisa lagta hai k koi stalker hai... Logon ki soch aise hi ho chuki hai...
"Aur kuch chutiye kehte hai Salman khan ko acting nahi aati....look at his eyes in this scene... it's totally telling the pain , seperation and suffering he is going through....Laut aao ye wala salman🥺👍",Salman knows how to acts . It's only that he just doesn't wanna act. He's not interested in this thing anymore.
"yes , bhoot police jada achi lagi,saif jaha hota hai waha boor nahi hone deta","Yeh baat toh sahi hai. Usko double mehnat karni padi, Arjun ke liye bhi. Actually triple. Jackie ke liye bhi."
I enjoyed Bhoot Police a fair bit. Found it to be funny and engaging. \n\nYet to watch Phone Bhoot. Not a fan of the cast. Is it good?,See yourself for 15 minutes and decide?
Phone bhoot is a fun watch too IG,It was a unique movie. Apart from the first and last 15 minutes the movie was entertaining and the chemistry of both male leads was fab.
"Oh that dialogue delivery was terrible, and the scene too, what were writers thinking, nepotism ye word daaldo log zabardasti me has hi denge",I think it was a cracker. And Bhoot Police had not even *one* sort of.\n\nOfcourse Jackie sucked in Dialogue delivery but the way she said seemed cute and the reaction of both Nepo Babies made it even funnier.
trash vs garbage,"Haha, good one. Arjun hai toh can't deny it's not a trash. Same with Siddhant."
this post and that one Swades scene. Forever content 😂\n\n[,also Taare Zameen Par scenes  😂
Last best KJ movie. He went downhill from there. It was a total epic collapse. His movies after MNIK was nothing like before.,Box Office says otherwise.  Only Reddit claims that.
"Believe it or not but Karan is genuinely a good director. Except student of the year which starred Alia(the reason for his downfall), all his movies were good \n\nKuch kuch hota hai, k3g and kal ho na ho have immense rewatch value",Kal ho na ho is not directed by KJo
Sometimes I think somebody else ghost directs KJ movies.,Funny because everyone thought the same with Kal Ho Naa Ho and that movies director because it was so good.  And it turned out to be true.  It was actually Karan Johar that did most of the work.  He's way better than you people give him credit for.
I've never seen a KJo movie that was unwatchable. He is consistent and delivers a good watch regardless of anything.,And rewatches.  His catalogue is unmatched.
"I think people need to give KJo more props as a director. He does cringe things as a producer but as a director, I think he’s a lot more artistic in his approach than for his produced movies. \n\nEven Rocky Rani, despite it being a standard KJo romcom, has a unique “retro Hindi cinema” aesthetic that makes it like a love letter to hindi cinema, and it’s a hallmark of a great director to have such a distinct visual aesthetic in their cinema.",Lol. watch Kabhi Kushi Kabhi gham
"I can’t believe this movie isn’t streaming on a single platform, I’ve been trying to watch it for so long!  This clip might be the push I need to just cave and buy it.",I bought it on YouTube ages ago is it not available there anymore?\n\nAlso maybe I have more options overseas.  It's owned by Fox Studios which is an American company after all.
Why tf is it so hard to believe mnik is by kjo?? He always been making good movies. Even rrkpk was good.,It’s cause this he’s known for the big over the top Bollywood musical style romantic films but this one strips away all of that and could be passed as an American production if no one knew that it was produced by Indians
He was good until this movie. His downfall as a director started with SOTY. He seems critical about his older films not pandering to typical woke isms and made an unbelievably preachy movie with RARKPK.,LOL this is such a funny take to me.  Because such a vocal part of this sub just craps on his All time classics for not being woke enough.  Then there's others like you who criticize him for adhering to modern mentalities.  The guy just can't win with some people.  Good thing most of the world loves him.
Jab woh aisi movie banata hai tab bhi koi dekhne nahi jaata so they stop making such films and give you masala Masss entertainer.,Bro what are you saying it was a hit at Domestic box office and An All time Blockbuster in international Market it's record outside India is still untouched 🔥
"""Bure waqt mein jo acha lage...""\n\nThat plumber alone increased the EQ in that room...😭🙏",That line just makes me laugh for 15 mins Everytime🤣🤣🤣
One of the best disfunctional family depiction in a bollywood movie.,This same director tried to infuse the dysfunctional family angle into his previous movie ek main aur ek tu. He failed miserably at that attempt. But he tried again in this movie and provided an absolute gem in the genre. We need more dysfunctional family set movies in mainstream bollywood.
Saale ek thappad tere ko bhi padega 😭😭😭😭,Papa ji seeing me after Chhota Bhai kuch kaand kar de 💀🙏
"Monsoon weeding, Bheja Fry, English Vinglish, Do Dooni Char, Dil Dhakane Do had those moments.",I guess in khatta meetha. When Akshay go to Asrani shop to borrow some money.
‘Aaj mere bina hi shuru ho gaye’ 😂😂😂 one of my fav movies,Mine too! And so real. I was like did they spy on my family to write these scenes?
Fawad is such a good actor.,It's a pity he isn't able to work in the HFI. Artists should be excluded from this India pak drama.
So basically Animal “Ranbir Kapoor” dialogue is copied from this scene of “Kapoor & Sons”\n\n,And later in the movie he got actually Behra.
"This one came to my mind.\n\n""Aapka left ya mera left"" Sunil Shetty \n\n",You reminded me of Sunil shetty and mahima chaudry  in yeh mera ghar yeh Tera ghar\n\nAlso has dialogues like this
listening to what?,"What the director wants, the Acting which looks so real seems like , its an actual scene from middle class family. the True Chaos."
Watch Anatomy of a great actor by Cinema beyond Entertainment on YouTube. Acting is just good re-acting.,I learned that from Joey on Friends 😄
I literally read that in Chatur's voice and his tone 😭,"Kyun ,   Kya hui...... Jahan panah tohfo qubool karo"
Rancho and Farhan did Chaturn dirty. He had every right to be pissed off.,You are right bro chatur was so nice he used to deliver Dirty magazines to all the students before exam nights.
"Looking at it now, chatur was quite successful as well.",He also did hard work.
A memorable date after 2 October...iykyk,Remind me after 4 weeks
"Unpopular opinion: Rancho was leading his friends who were middle class to failure while he had no obligation to get a degree.\n\n\nBoth Farhan and Raju received a job by a one in a million chance . \n\n\nOther than the fact that chatur distributed porn magazines, he was right with everything.\n\n\nAnd also taking advantage of someone's lack of knowledge in hindi to deliver a bad speech and humiliating in front of college was too much.\n\n\nRancho should be happy that Chatur didn't become a serial killer who targeted his bullies like in the Korean tv show "" king of pigs"" ( Amazon prime)",It says it isn’t available in your location on Amazon prime. Where can I watch king of pigs?
"Hum chillate hue thak jayenge, lekin ye log kabhi nahi sudhrenge. Hum jaise ki baddua bhi kaam nahi aati hai inlogo pe.","exactly . the film looks real, the incident inthat film looks real , the character the actors the royal aura everything looks so fucking real , even aditya as a smart ass weirdo looks real . the songs, the situations the backstory . each character has the weight they are not mere fillers . they have made a joke out of it"
"the whole purpose of bhul bhulaiyaa was that there is no ghost, these idiots brought a real ghost which lost the purpose.","This. I watched 2nd one in hope of non ghost, climax but just with the >! initial story of two twin sisters I could figure out the plot and !< was  disappointed.\n\nAnd the 3rd one seems more weird..."
they dont care about ur nostalgia but BO numbers,"broo , this is biziness ,"
I will never forgive them for their decision to recreate 'Labon Ko' song.,What? They did that?
"Akshay was too good in this film, straight up one of top acts of 2007",And Welcome too came out same year. Akki was on fire that year
Kartik Aryan has the acting range of a sack of wheat flour. \nAnees Bazmee can't hold a candle to Priyadarshan. So yeah I do not see any reason that they would create anything meaningful and profound.,BB 1 was a scene-to-scene copy of Fazils original. Even many of the angles are the same.
"Now if someone brought Manichitrathazhu, a 1993 film no less, you guys wouldn't agree with that person's criticism of ""making irreplaceable damage to nostalgia"" lol\n\nI love Bhool Bhulaiya. But I remember annoyed Malayalis and Tamil people who felt their version is better. Basically everything in today's pop culture is a xerox of a xerox. But that doesn't mean you demean a current film to ""spoil"" your childhood movie. Judge the film as is and don't take it as a hit to your personal nostalgia. Even great movies like Don and Scarface are remakes. You cannot hate a person for trying. You can however hate a person for failing at a cash grab lol.","As a malayali.. I wasn't mad at Bhool Bhulaiyya at all because it the most realistic remake of the movie and among the remakes, it was easily the best one. \n\nAnd it wouldnt have been so if anyone else other than priyadarshan directed it. \n\nPriyadarshan understood the soul of the source perfectly and did a scene to scene remake, him actually directing few parts of manichitrathazhu actually helped."
I am not sure but Akshay was offered bhool bhulaiya 2 and he rejected the script and after seeing the movie I feel he did the right thing the film was not up to the mark one time watch but not the level of a sequel and see how quickly the third part came the makers just using the hype of sequels and this will earn I guess then 4th part will come and the scene goes on and on,Imagine AK rejecting a script is such rare phenomenon and still they went ahead with this shit.
"Bollywood can't do horror comedies right, and when they do one right, they get excited by the prospect of a niche genre working in India that they try to up the game, add more masala and songs, and dramatize it more to cater to a wider audience as possible, and cheapen the humor so it becomes tacky and slapstick for cheap laughs. Failing to realize what worked with the film was none of that but actual good content.\n\nStree 1 nailed the horror comedy aspect of the film. It was subtle, down right chilling in areas that mattered and coherently well put together. Then comes along Stree 2, barely hanging by the threads of the first film, and I know I will get shit for saying this, but the movie sucked. The fact that it did such numbers means that they will release even more films like that, and more producers will look at Stree 2 than the first one and make more of the same.\n\nStree 2 doesn't stand on its own legs without the work Stree 1 had put in.","Stree 2 wasn’t as good as Stree 1 but that was the most sequelly sequel ever made.  I mean they literally brought the same star cast back. Kept the same story line and the lead actors and followed from where Stree 1 ended. Most importantly, perfectly blended comedy with horror elements even if it was less spooky than the original. And this is coming from someone who isn’t a fan of horror comedies."
Vidya balan wtf. Holy shit. Ma'am you're a gorgeous woman,‘ma’am’ why do indians talk like this? i swear youtube comment sections are filled with indians going maam maam so gorgeous maam.
Deepika had the best run in 2013,Yes. Back when Alia and Karan were not the mafia.
what a year Deepika had. unmatched.,it was her year
"forgot to add ugly, ek thi daayan and shuddh desi romance",oh shit fukrey too
"And from 2013, we got beginning of the Arijit Singh Era and all those bangers were started to kicking off in 2013...","As good as he is, his era has absolutely fkd Bollywood up. Nobody wants to take any risk and he keeps getting 50 songs a year"
So you're saying my entire Bollywood personality is based on 2013?? Damn,Funny because that was considered a mid year then compared to 2007-2012.
Queen and Jolly LLB were easily the best of the lot. Lootera 3rd,"Also, Go goa gone"
I WILL NEVER SEE APPRECIATION FOR DHOOM 3 AND SIT SILENT. I MUST REGISTER MY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE FILM.,so flawed but i still enjoyed it ngl
"Chennai Express, Dhoom 3, and Race 2\n\n",bro chennai express is elite
Ankahee ✨,Aankhee - the Aftab Amisha Esha starrer? That was definitely before 2013 but what movie!\n\nMusic was underrated but Pritam was at his best on that album
Omggg so many good movies in a single year??? Omgggg\nI can’t remember anything worth watching except lapata ladies for this years ugh,"Article 370, Stree2, Savarkar\n\nAlso Khel Khel Main, Shaitaan, Crew, TMBAUJ etc. worth a watch, though not great per se."
"He was everything that we need today to make Bollywood awesome again, if only people watch his movies, take inspiration from his techniques, they might make better movies. \n\nTalking about raj Kapoor sahab.",He was a creep
u/mitakshi_\n\nI just have a feeling that you'd like this video...,just abhi around 50 minutes pehle i saved this video because uss time wifi wasn't working... (its still not working 😭)
"its not like their command over english is strong either... they cannot speak for more than 2 mins without using the filler words and phrases like, 'like', 'i was like', 'you know', 'yaa'","When someone says 'yaa' ,I can't remember anyone other than ananya pandey lol"
Tbh Sara’s Hindi is significantly better than these other nepos,How dare you have nuance in your judgement?? Nepo bad
These girls can't even speak English properly.,"This. These nepos doesn’t have what it takes to act outside of India. Whatever little they are bringing to the table the Indians born and raised outside are already doing it better. Whatever image they are trying to portray of themselves, rich, weird Hinglish accent and copied mannerisms is only going to work in Bollywood because of their connections. I’m glad in 2024 we saw a rise in recognition of South movies. There were some great Malayalam movies that came out and were very well received by the audience all over the country. If Bollywood doesn’t learn from this and keep making repetitive movies like Sky Force, Deva and Singham the worse it will get for them."
"The new girls are all useless, wannabe ig models at best. I'm waiting for them to get married and disappear. Hopefully the new crop will be better and more Indianised.",damn you just laid it all out huh😭
>sound even more like foreigners \n\nI live in the US and desi kids born and raised here speak better hindi\n\nThese nepos are just wanna bes,Im one of those desi kids and not even Indian and I speak better Hindi 🥲
"This irks me a lot too, but actually the problem with current gen star kids is that they grew up in a “desi NRI” surrounding. Imagine yourself talking to your friends and parents in English 24/7 and then you have to act in a hindi film industry, how will they get the diction right. Its actually not possible, no matter how many dialogue or dialect coaches they take.",I know rt!! Its so stupid. I remember Kjo said once he writes his scripts in English. So glad that his movies are flopping now. Nepo elitist pos.
"I have a doubt, All these nepo kids, is hindi their mother tongue? If hindi isn't your mother tongue nor was the language u conversed outside home, it can influence the way u speak.\n\nBut if your profession is language dependent, then you have to learn it and polish your language skill. I appreciate shreya Ghoshal for this, she knows how to pronounce words in languages others than hindi especially her malayalam songs!!! Difficult language to talk, but she nails it in her malayalam songs.","Shreya is a hardworking singer. Had a chance to witness her recording live. She writes lyrics on her own, asks the lyricist to sing for correcting her pronunciation never says no for recording if something gets missed"
"Maybe that's why all the movies of ananya that I like her performance in, has her character speaking more english \n\nGehraiyan, ctrl,etc",Their English isn’t very good either.
Ananya's dialogue delivery lowkey gives me old katrina vibes tbh,"Which is extremely embarrassing considering Ananya grew up in a country and household that speaks hindi and has watched Bollywood growing up supposedly, yet is at the same level as Katrina who came to a new country and learned a new language from the beginning."
It started with Sonam Kapoor naaaa?,Sonam’s dialogue delivery is weak but I thought her Hindi was fine..atleast much better than the current bunch. She atleast acted decently enough most of the time and had a naturally pretty face. Was not embarrassing or intolerable like these girls acting wise is what I mean. Maybe some roles but mostly she’s perfectly watchable
Jimmy sergil was such a cutie 💗,He still looks great
"Jimmy Shergill was the best looking of the lot. And he’s still handsome. Older, but handsome.",Jugal Hansraj is pretty good looking even now.
Jimmy Shergill 😍,Haina he is so good looking 💗🤌
Jimmy has been wasted by Bollywood & the audience..,Yeah he deserve more
"Somewhere Between Then & Now, We All Grew Up! \n\n",I was 15-16 when this movie was released. We grew up no doubt about that.
Oh god...I didn't even recognize Uday,Ya what happened to him?!
"“Mohabbatein cast”\n\nSo ash, the three girls, big b, Anupam kher, archana weren’t in the movie then? Just say male leads. Would it be ok to make a post saying Mohabbatein cast and showing only the four ladies?",Yes i wouldn't mind that either.
"the people triggered by the post only containing the male cast members are probably missing that this was a (not so) covert attempt by the original video creator, probably a srk stan, to show how srk has stayed in shape and gotten better looking as he ages as compared to the other younger actors. Jugal Hansraj was done dirty in the pic featured of him. He actually has a sliver fox look and is doing well. Jimmy Shergill is still acting and looking as good as ever. Uday Chopra, well.",Srk has to stay in shape cuz he’s still bankable. The real srk must look worse than he’s portrayed on screen.
My crush in one movie,All characters were so good
Jimmy my first crush 😻 ooohhh look at him,Haina the innocence of that look 🤌💗
"Me in theatre: \n\nSayad Left Wala roh rah hai , \n\npar awaj samne se bhi aa rahi hai , \n\nLeft Wala roh raha hai ya right Wala .\n\nYa aalah pura theatre ro raha hai",Are mere lap pe paani kaha se tapak raha hai? \n\nOh shit!!
"Might be over thinking but if India manages to win this world cup , Dravid - Kabir ( Shahrukh in this movie) story might be similar. \n\nBoth were considered biggest reason for their team not winning world cup ( Dravid in 2007). Now its coming to full circle as India is hot favourite to win this edition and Dravid as coach","Well there could be similarities but not many accuse dravid as sole reason for not winning that world cup the whole squad did poorly and he wasn't critised much.\nEven before he started coaching indian national team he was respected and still called ""wall'\n\n\n\nIn this movie \nhowever he was labelled as traitor and then made indian women team reach glory for the very first time \nSo i think scenarios are totally different.\n This scene shows his redemption that not only he finally managed to win something for his country (if not as player then as a coach) and also knew all the allegations of him being traitor will now be erased."
"This movie is probably the best that Bollywood has to offer. I still remember seeing it in a single screen theatre with my mom when I was in class 6. Right after Vidya Sharma saved the last penalty, my mom stood up and started clapping. I've never seen her clap that way. She sobbed with SRK as if the Indian Womens Team winning the world cup was one of her personal victories. She had had to give up her teaching career to take care of the family and bring us up. Now I understand why I kept staring at her sobbing face in awe. \n\nP.S - She resumed teaching again once I passed class 10. 😇",Wholesome stories like these. 🧡
Also requires an actor who can express without dialogs. Imagine Katrina trying to do something like that 😂😂,Bhai tum mood kharab karo bas.
Too much overacting. Just find any underdog team reacting anywhere close to it . Overtly artificial but that is what is needed and appreciated,"Common man! Just understand the context here . The guy who was considered as a traitor and the reason for the country's defeat , now becomes the coach of the winning National team which makes the whole country proud ."
3rd class acting,Less than lord Mudiiiiiii
"Dude. The last locker room speech is copied/inspired from Gridiron Gang.\n\nHowever popular this movie is, I never liked it and instantly recognized that speech. Lol.","Bollywood word itself is copied, what do you expect ? they lack originality or vision. I'd rather watch regional cinema for something original."
Swades sabse badi hit kiu nahi hai ye mai aaj tak nahi smjh paya par chalo atleast rang de basanti got all the love,"Usme masala nahi tha, Rang de basanti mein gaane mast tha, friendship thi, Aamir Khan ka naya roop dekhne ko mila aur dance bhi. 2nd half se film thoda serious hogayi warna 1st half toh Puri dosto ki mauj ke upar thi."
The internet is hard at work these days to convince me to watch RDB again.,Sahi mein yaar maine last month hi dekhi thi abhi ye sare movies ek aur baar dekhne padenge 😭
Goosebumps. But can someone please give me a list of all movies featured here?,"Rang De Basanti, Swades, Raazi, Shershaah, Gold, Dunki. Hope I didn't miss any."
All of us don't even sing 'Vande mataram' together!\nSadly the above is devided by religion!,Does singing vande maataram make one a patriot. Jana gana mana gaa lo. Vande maataram is usually not sung by Muslims coz they are barred by religio to not eulogise anyone their mother or God figure other than Allah. It does not mean that they do not love their nation. \n\nNationalistic symbols are exactly that symbols - our actions matter the most.
Could someone please name all the movies?,Rang de basanti\n\nSwades\n\nMulk\n\nThe legend of Bhagat Singh\n\nRaazi\n\nGold\n\nDunki
Do they follow what they are saying tho,Haan na it's so ironic watching all these multi millionaires saying all this stuff
"Caste, religion, traditions, different languages makes us the most unique and diverse country and we used to say that in pride but right now the same thing is changing and dividing the country based on caste/religion and on language as well.\nThe only hope is the upcoming generation understands the diversity part and accepts this diversity.\n\nBut on the side yes we need strict action on internal terrorism happening across the country (all caste and religion included) that's been the main reason behind the divided mindset.",You die a hero or live long enough to see yourself becoming a villain.\n\nThat is caste for India now
It doesn't fit with today's circumstances,I guess it's still relavant
Rang de basanti was a commie movie. Learn from what's happening in bangladesh.,Look at what is happening in India\n\nWhy do we need to look at Bangladesh or Pakistan?
"Also let's not forget these spectacular films too-\nUdaan, masaan, Haider, no smoking, ship of Theseus!!","It's not about movie, it's the message"
" saying, Jhanvi(Urmila) offered Kajal(Sridevi) a pretty great deal",The character name was Jhanvi 🤯
Umm I watched Raja ki ayegi baraat. So the whole movie was weird. Will recommend if you want to punish yourself or anyone else.,I watched that movie when i was 10😭
We watched this movie together. My wife and I discussed this in detail. My wife said she would take the deal if money is right.,One time we were talking about something and one Aunty said tera pari heera hai and I joked koi khareed raha hai to main bechne ko tayar hoon. My god Aunty was so deeply offended she glared at me for the rest of the party.

And still got him back by crying and begging for him to come back. So really good deal considering she kept money and got her husband back lol,"To be honest I didn't like the ending myself but considering how different the audience was back then , it made sense to end it in that note..\n\nRaj's children called Jhanvi (Urmila) ""Maa"" in that movie which Kajal (Sridevi) reprimanded that.. and that alone made me realise that the children would have made an even deeper connection with Jhanvi than they did with Kajal if more time were given to them..."
Yeah she should have sold him for atleast 5 crores… he’s for 3 crore’s worth of hair,"2 crore was not a small amount back then, adjusting for inflation."
Abba dabba jabba!!,Omg that one was so irritating 😅😅
"Some movie... Shilpa Shirodkar keeps burning every piece of her outfit so that the doctor (Manisha Koirala) can perform surgery on the patient (apna hero).... Because you know, that happens","Jai Hind: The Pride. But in front of Manoj Kumar's previous masterpiece Clerk, it was nothing."

Jaoge lene award tab toh denge.,There's a reason he stopped going
"Funny similarities on wife and brother but Aamir's concern about awards has always been a bit exaggerated because Aamir has actually won 9 Filmfare awards - 3 for Best Actor, 1 for Best Actor Critics, 1 for Best Debut and 3 for Best Film as producer. He has also won 4 National awards, 6 Zee Cine Awards, 6 Screen Awards, 3 IIFA awards etc.",1 oscar nomination too
feel sad for zaira wasim.. radical groups forced her quit acting.,Exactly the point this movie set out to prove
"bro philanders around, bro got petty and decided to walk away from stuff, bro did some shady stuff to sibling\n\nthen bro goes like- listen to my feelings bro\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbro......",What’s the philanders around story. Haven’t heard anything yet.
he also has a kid with a british journalist and abandoned her around the same year he married kiran rao,Yeah she is now happily married with a London business man \nWith her child jaan (from Amir khan).
"The concept of this movie was so good, but it was garbage.",Bhai music ha*am hai 💀
its just me or i find his dialogue delivery bad!,The most overacting he did was in Dil chahta hai
"Ajay-Atul went GOD MODE for this movie's album. From BGM to Songs, firing on all cylinders.",Ajay Atul + Sonu Nigam is just *chef's kiss*. I also really enjoyed the fact that Roop Kumar Rathod sang Saiyaan instead of a female singer. Added another layer of dimension.
Goosebumps 🥶 Man Hrithik was Good but Sonu Nigam bro he's a genius no one can come close to him in Emotional Songs ....,It’s not just because of Sonu but the music does the wonder credits to Ajay-Atul.
They don't make them like this anymore😪,"I swear, they don’t make movies, songs or actors like this anymore."
i feel agneepath didnt receive the love it deserved,"Always felt this as an epic scene and first time actually see posts on it, damn glad. amazing on all fronts."

This movie is everything! Why it had to end like that 😭 the writer was unfair to Kalpana 😭,"if the writer were fair to her, it would have become a run of the mill movie, and we won't be remembering it like we do now."
fine I’ll rewatch Ghajini again 😭,Pichli baar dekh ke bhool gaye kya huzzkyy
Mannnnnn it still bothers me to this day that she died without knowing Sachin was Sanjay Singhania 🥲,Your pain is for 15 years and Our pain is for 18 years.
Need Aamir to another masala movie like ghajini very soon!!!!,Still boggles my mind why he agreed to make the Pirates of Hindustan. That whole movie was cringe

One of the fine movies Bollywood evr made with truly beautiful songs😭😭,Bhai copy thi yeh movie.\n\nAcchi thi but memento ki copy thi.
Misses the time when hindi movies had innocence in female portray.,"Sacrificing , wears non revealing clothes, always putting her husband’s need first = innocence??"
Suriya's gajani >>>>>,Asin as Kalpana >>>>>> Asin as Kalpana tho
"He is a good actor, but your post sounds more like a jab.",Yes its more like backhanded compliment!
"Dhanush has created a niche movie type, most of the characters he plays being so relatable. The dude next door persona is what made him so loved in Tamil. In an era of over the top heroism he is one of the actors who stands apart.\nAnother mainstream actor I loved for this was the great Irrfan Khan (RIP)!",अगले घर का लड़का ।
"I think it is also the way he is dressed and where he is placed. When you check SRK's movies from the 2000s for example, he is always dressed with different colours than the dancers and placed before them. There the actor is wearing a plain shirt and trousers with colours similar to those behind him and he is placed horizontally to them - if I am not mistaken. This gives an impression that he is a part of the group and not the focus. Also camera moves are important. There's a gif with Shah Rukh khan dancing among dancers except the camera is moving towards him emphasizing the focus on the spectator on him.\n\n\nYeh Ladhka Hai Yallah from K3G is a good example. There SRK and Kajol are distinctly dressed. SRK wears dark colours whereas the line just behind him are in light colours. They are also behind him not next to him. The character is also always at the centre of the camera focus (? I don't know the term in English). Kajol is in yellow whereas the dancers behind her are in blue, purple or at least darker colours. She's at leat one meter away from the dancers and in front facing the camera.\n",This sub has a dearth of people who actually understand cinematography.\n\nYou do make a lot of sense in here. It's always great to read good writeups\n\nAlso yeh ladka hai Allah is such a beautiful song
"I dont know about Dhanush whether he js a good person or not, but his acting prowess is top notch and man he looks good why are people shitting in the comms are beyond me","And the worst / best thing is he improved his performances over so many years. It's best because we could see how sincere he is to the job, but worst because he could afford this plainly due to nepotism."
his pedestrian face makes him blend in. not to mention the thin body,>pedestrian face\n\nYou mean sadak chaap?
What? How is this any different from any dance number in bollywood?,Tamil actors look like mainstream Indians. Most bollywood actors have middle eastern looks (Punjabi/Sindhi/Afghan). So they stand out just by appearance.  Dhanush has the added advantage of slender build and average hairstyle. SRK in his early days looked pretty average.
Northies can't comprehend that people can have dark skin and still be considered humans.,"Ironically, most of them are dark skinned themselves"
"What puts me off about this song is terrible lip sync by Dhanush, except that one slow motion shot in between.",I just observed this now lol. His lip sync is indeed bad
I mean let’s be honest. Would he been this famous if he didn’t have connections?,Would he be successful in Bollywood even with connections?
He does look like a genuine chhapri.,using casteist slurs in 2024 is crazy
You missed this\n\n,That interrogation sequence…also been too long since a filmmaker used Dobriyal as a lead and that too so perfectly
Absolutely loved Merry Christmas! Such an underrated movie.,"But it was super predictable. Might have worked in 90s with a strong emotional connection. Given a sriram raghavan film, I was waiting as waiting for a twist or something at end but Vinay's character just went to jail, just like that.. Not typical sriram raghavan."
Jigra was average.,lol OP tried to sneak that one in pretending to be a decent movie
Snuck in jigra and CC to rage bait but they ain't worthy.,Exactly! And merry Christmas too no?
People still say Bollywood don't make good movies after watching cringe pushpa,It’s about the percentage of good movies. Every industry has good and bad films. A few good films doesn’t make an Industry standout. Look at Malayalam film industry. They make so many world class films with such a small industry.
"Bollywood actually makes better movies than, Telugu and Tamil and Kannada.. just the boycott Bollywood and SSR death created a room for telugu movies, people in anger started watching shitty Telugu movies, sahoo, salar, Pushpa whatever that shit people watched it.",Tamil? No way. Telugu? Yes. No clue about kannada.
"unrelated Unpopular Opinion: in Chandu Champion, the character having such defined abs  is really off-putting and kills the connection.\n\nedit: Jigra was an average movie as well, forgettable\n\n  \nedit 2: pretty shitty list man, went through it again and this has to be the most surfacial and ""bad"" representation of bollywood if your objective was to highlight good movies that came out of Bollywood",">pretty shitty list man, went through it again and this has to be the most surfacial and ""bad"" representation of bollywood if your objective was to highlight good movies that came out of Bollywood\n            \nThese are the best of 2024 from bollywood tf are YOU talking about ??? It's not a bad representation of bollywood IMHO (not too sure about jigra and chandu champion cause I haven't watched them so won't comment on it but other then that the list is a fair representation of the other side of bollywood 2024)"
The fact that just 3 weeks of any 2000s year movies eat this list alive lol \n\nThe quality has dropped heavily,"I wouldn't say so though.\n\nI fully agree that average quality is worse than shit these days, but it wasn't THAT good in 2000s. \n\nI'd challenge you to show me 3 consecutive weeks with 8 great movies from the entirety of 2000s."
chandu champion was so bad,Why though? (Asking genuinely)
I want to talk review?,It's a one time OTT watch for sure. Abhishek Bachchan gets out the big guns. \n\nAkela uthaya hai movie
Exercise routine provided by celebrity trainers\n\nPersonal chefs\n\nGenetics\n\nAtleast on TRT(maybe on Steroids/HGH),You'd be too naive to think steroids don't make part of these chiseled body types at this age snd that too on demand.
1. Skincare (Sunscreen and Retinol)\n2. Botox\n3. Plastic Surgery (Not Saying HR but def others)\n4. TRT and Steroids under medical supervision\n5. Private Chefs to cook all their food for them\n6. Great Nutrition with High Protein Diet (Prepared by #5),"one big disadvantage of steroids is infertility. Seeing that he had his children early in life i don't think he plans to have more kids , also he has resources to store is seed in professional cold storage."

"To obtain that body they go on various PEDs like testosterone, deca and they look like that for a few hours as it requires water depletion for 1 day.",The water depletion is the toughest part. Especially since there's already such low energy at single digit body fat.
"Almost 60 years old SRK is bulking up for movies with no past history of bodybuilding, and you are surprised with 49 years old HR body when he has always been regarded as a Greek God in Bollywood.",SRK and almost all Hollywood/Bollywood men use some type of PEDs to bulk up for their movies under a doctor's supervision and then dehydrate for their shirtless scenes to make their abs pop. Still impressive for SRK's age though.
because they maintain their health and eat a nutritious diet (and botox🤫),Forgot trt and other supplements
"I am kind of shocked with all the comments here, anyone can achieve that type of body with a good diet and routine muscle training. Have you guys not seen any white folks, they are average middle class folks and they have muscles and body lot better than Hrithik or any bollywood star, just look at YT. I know many who are bulkier and better, do not make an excuse of not having money or expensive diet. Most of Indians won't just let go of their work life to invest in their health. You DO NOT need steroids to bulk up if you invest time and good source of protein.","Umm are you comparing Indian genetics with that of American folk?! That is a grave misconception. I agree that with a good diet and prioritizing recovery one can reach a decent physique, but also factor in that in men testosterone naturally starts to decline after the age of 40. So these celebrities most certainly use exogenous sources of testosterone like Trt."
"By not consuming or skincaring what they advertise and following strict diet and exercise.\n\nAlso needless to say, a good sleep and active sex life",TF has sex life to do with this? LOL
Meko bhi aise naachna hai without falling sick afterwards,Uske liye manic pixi dream girl banna padega
"For some reason, I always thought Ar Rahman was the music composer for this movie","The Airtel ringtone had the same vibes, and that was Rehman"
"This is a Tamil film originally, no?  Minnale, I believe. Great BGM nevertheless! Harris Jayaraj is a brilliant composer.",This scene was lifted from a Telugu movie Tholi Prema if we want to really dig down to the genesis
That is beautiful. I would nominate this theme from Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na ,"Omg! I have spent years, YEARS looking for this ! \nGave me goosebumps every time I heard it in the movie"
"Its not even bollywood, its an original tamil movie","Who's talking about the origin? Even if it's from a Tamil movie, it can still be the best in Bollywood. What do you mean ""its not even Bollywood"" it literally is.. Copied.. But Bollywood😂"
"I don't understand people who say they hate/don't care for bollywood. I mean sure it has its flaws, but how can you hate something which shaped your perspective on love, life, and everything in between?",It’s because some of the shaping was good and some were not . Bollywood for example made me believe in love but also made stalking seem normal . Pros and cons
Is there a song with this bgm?,"Yes, nenjai poo pol koidhu vittal"
Which movie is this??,Rehna hai tere dil mein
Movie?,Rehna Hai Tere Dil Main
Priyadarshan to Aneez Bazmee,"I think we most often focus on the characters or the actor rather than the one producing such works , the screenwriters, the dialogue etc . Today’s bollywood movie are so damn bland or idiotic that even an oscar winning actor would look like an idiot."
8th mai jab pehli baar dekhi thi fattke chaar ho gyi thi. I was able to appreciate the humour much much later,"Post covid, people stopped appreciating great movies and went back to chutiya masala movies. Mujhe jabardasti le gaye the bhool bhulaiyaa 2 dekhne aur log chutiye humour par hans rahe the."
They could've simply worked on the dubbing. In part 1 it is sounding scary and possessed as if the ghost is talking. In the latest part it feels like someone is shouting from the 10th floor just to tell something.,The visuals are the bigger problem! It’s so fake and unoriginal. The first one is set up in a normal bedroom with normal looking Vidya who suddenly starts showing possessed behaviour - that’s creepy. \n\nNot someone screaming from the sky with wind blowing and graphics all around.
Meanwhile... _today it really is Durga ashtami_ \n😁😁😁,It's Saptami actually.  Asthami is tomorrow 😃
"Director ke naam dekh kar movies dekho, actors ka nahi",True man .... but this dumb generation won't understand 🤡
"I think it must be the unrelatable and irrelevant storyline. Any actor must want to relate to the story to give a realistic expression. In the latest release, it seems she was asked to recreate the scene and she couldn’t put much thought into the expression as even she couldn’t comprehend why she is doing it lol.",I think people are jumping the gun too soon. It's kinda unfair to judge the performance by the trailer itself. It's possible that they put in the OTT parts in the trailer for unexpectedness to reveal itself in the film.
"Ok, now tell me, how did they go from Manichithrathazhu to Bhulbhulayya!",They are now feeling the same frustration malayalees feel when they watch various remakes of Manichirthrathaazh…
A director remaking a huge film (Priyadarshan)that was already hit in multiple languages (each version better than the other) to a director whose name I never heard of and had to Google (Anees Bazmee) I honestly saw none of his movies... He must be working hard but yeah there will definitely be a difference in quality,wtf when did manichitrathazhu become priyadarshan’s film? the legendary fazil never existed or what? stop yapping with half knowledge.
"Some movies are better when shot on film, and not on digital. Filmmakers today have forgotten the value of 35mm since digital gives them many liberties.","Directors nowadays think VFX can makeup for the writing, filming and acting when that clearly isn’t the case."
People saying it is about going from Priyadarshan to Anees Bazmee. I say it is going from Neeraj Vora to whoever the fuck wrote the screenplay that lead to that. And Anees Bazmee.,"You are wrong, you guys went from Madhu K Panicker to who ever wrote the script/ screenplay of this atrocity. \n\nNeeraj vohra couldnt have done shit if the original source never existed. \n\nIn fact I would go as far as to say that Neeraj Vohra and Priyadarshan watered down and spoilt the complex and layered script of the original"
Pathaan prequel 💀,Why Jim became Jim 😜
My ex went to watch this movie with her boy best friend 🥲,I feel you bro 🥺
The fact ki sab almost gore theiy plane mei and he was speaking hindi💀💀💀💀💀,Haan bhai next time documentary bana denge . Sab sahi sa.
Full bakchodi thi mst isme. And action was also good. \n\nAs I said multiple times before. Nolan k chode audience hogyi h. Movies are for entertainment and timepass. Baaki genres are secondary.,Haa yaar bhot mast movie thi yaar aur vo wala scene jisme ek unknown call aata tha isko vo sb badhiya tha like abke audience ko mazaa naa aaye but tab jab dekha tab badhiya lga tha
"And no one in the airplane knew Hindi, still clapping 😂 (Bollywood logic > Einstein logic)",Bhai pehle movie dekhlo pyra movie aisa hi hai
"Except for that dog part ,everything was good",Yaar vo bi acha tha 😂😂
The climax of this movie is so dumb💀💀💀… agar 1 kandha tuta hai toh dusra bhi tod lo teekh ho jaega🤣🤣🤣,Yaad nhi konsa scene tha 😂😂😂 but ye movie mei kuch bi aisa tha nhi jisme dimaag lagane hai bas dekhke mazze lene ka hai sirf pehle jo cheating wala sequence hi serious tha baki puri movie mei toh sirf aur sirf bakch**di kr rhe the aur isme aisa tha ki pehle serious scene hoga fir Varun Dhawan kuch bkch*di krega fir firse ek serious scene fir firse vahi repeat 🤣
Inspired from rush hour?,Yup! They also call each J and K like in Men in Black movies.. \nMan we need more buddy comedy movies!!
It goes both ways as well. They zoom in on Amitabh's face whenever Rekha is on stage and he's busy pretending he likes the surroundings more.,"Lol, I watched an award show in a recent year and Rekha danced to a song she did with Amitabh whilst the camera zoomed right to him staying straight faced. Glad Jaya wasn't there atleast!"
*and abhishek didnt even get invited to see his dad look at his crush* 😂,Uska koun sa crush?
And just fyi guys the final show you see on tv is heavily edited. So when you think you are seeing rekhas reaction to amitabh it's probably just her reaction from some other part of the show chipkaoed over there,Lol yeah in the 2016 actors roundtable they talked about that
"He has several great entry scenes. But somehow Jawan ones hit differently because it's from a South director, they know how to use the bgm and make the perfect entry scene.",Atlee knows his shit.
"Out of all the 20+ entries of SRK in this movie, this one was the best.",I see what you did there😉
Anirudh should be praised too for that sexy bgm,"Absolutely. Even the interval scene was elevated by the BGM. Atlee's stylishly shot action scenes, SRK'S charming screen presence and Atlee's BGM created great moments in the movie."
"Theatre me alag hit hua tha, when everyone is clapping and hooting, akele baith ke dekho toh woh feel missing lagti hai, then you start to see the flaws and everything lol",Mass movie hai itna dimaag mat lagao
No shit! Atleast 5 times during this scene I thought it couldn't get any better and BOOM (it got better),"Lmao, bro same! \n\nForever grateful to Atlee for presenting him like the absolute GOD that he is. 🔥"
"For me this was his best entry. The setting, the visuals, the bgm, I had tears rolling down when I watched this scene.",Wait till you see him dressed in all black getting off a helicopter and running towards a mansion near Chandni Chowk while Jaya bachhan waits at the door with pooja thali
"It's really fascinating to see Bolly people fascination with Jawan cos we people in the south are irritated with Atlee's copyrighted style.\n\nBut then again, I loved Pathaan, and the South hates that too so ig it's individualistic liking","I am Telugu, and I liked Bigul because of this graphic novel wala treatment.\n\nSo I guess it depends on how many times you watch the same style. For me watching SRK in this style was the novel factor, and that's exciting.\n\nOf course, if the director is just using the same camera shots and shot style for every star hero entry , the novelty factor wears down fast. Atlee is new for Bollywood, so it's ok for now, I guess."
Sorry but his best and most iconic entry is from Main Hoon Na. Major Ram getting down of a train. All this action is total BS.,"I'm not saying this is his best entry, but it's ""one of his best"""
Lmao. What if that spear stabbed innocent girls. How did srk measure exact force needed to throw spear in a way that stabs bad guy but stop before hurting innocent civilians.\n\nsure it's cinema. They were going to die anyway so srk tried his luck. But Momentum just stopping abruptly like that looks weird and editing is also bad.\nCinematography looks good that's it. Technical aspects are bad,Abey lun.. jaa ke Salaar dekh aur aise logical questions ki list bana ke pooch.
Gareebo ka moon knight 😂,This is the highest grossing movie of the year. And SRK is one of the richest actors in the world.
"Didn't complete the movie. It was very stressful to watch. And these problems are too real. As a man, I have always been safe from this, but have seen these things happen with 2 friends, and I am talking about millenials here, ffs.",Fr too triggering to watch at certain points
I honestly think people shouldn’t be complaining about this being a remake. \n\nIf there’s one film that SHOULD be remade in all languages and shown across India - all states - it’s “The Great Indian Kitchen” (this was already remade in Tamil with the same name and starred Aishwarya Rajesh) / Mrs. (this is the second remake).,"Exactly. When I watched the great Indian kitchen, I wanted everyone to watch it but I knew people won't when I tell them it's not in hindi. Not a fan of remakes but glad this is gaining popularity and should be played on cable tv as well."
The great indian kitchen should be remade in every Indian language.,"Yup, every will understand better at their local level."
"It's a good remake, my only gripe is they watered it down to make it mainstream which is understandable and lacks the suffocation feel of the OG imo","pls i felt suffocated enough watching this one. i don’t know if i’d be able to take it if it was worse. the shikanji scene at the end made me so anxious, i was holding my breath the entire time."
"I’m confused, if this is an adaptation of the great indian kitchen then why is this sent to film festivals and not the original?",Adaptations and remakes can still be good and sent to film festivals. The Departed by Scorsese was a remake (it had been multiple times before him iirc) but the Hollywood version still won Academy Awards.
I hope this means Sanya gets mainstream success!,Don't hope too much
Can anybody explain the ending. I found it unsatisfactory with no karma to the ones who did bad . It was so frustrating!,"The ending is closer to real life just like the movie. In india if you are earning well as male and you are from a good family, it is very easy to get remarried. Life goes on for all such folks.\n\nRemember this was not a movie on domestic violence where the culprits need to be jailed. This movie shows the bad effects of Patriarchy where even the educated behave in a very entitled way. Such things are not punished by law or society."
Watched kathal recently. I am love with this womans acting!,Kathal was really good. My parents watched Kathal and they liked it so much that they ended up watching all of Sanya Malhotra's movies that they could find. She's their favourite actress now.
The ending was kinda exaggerated. She shouldn't have served them dirty water and run away with his car,What should the character have done ?
ngl i am disappointed now that i know this is also a remake\n\nat this point making remakes are WORSE than nepodis\n\nedit: everyone shits on remakes so why the heck is everyone downvoting?? nothing against the film. the film is good BUT my question is bollywood khud ka kuch original kyu nahi karta?? why they have to copy EVERYTHING,"Why is a remake about an issue which still persists in many indian households bad? Great Indian Kitchen was good and arguably better than Mrs. But Mrs. Is bringing this topic to many more households and starting conversations around the topic. And it's not like the movie is bad or shabby, it is a good movie as well.."
"It was adaptation of Hamlet by Shakespeare.. story is almost same. Hence, the revenge. But adaptation on the scenario of Kashmir makes it controversial.",No one does Shakespeare better than Vishal Bhardwaj in India.
"If you ever wonder why art in film is dying. If you ever want to wonder why media literacy is dead just look at the caption of this post. \n\nHe’s a doctor who chose to follow the oath he took because it’s part of his own moral fiber. Whether he made the right or wrong decision is a question the film asks us…what subsequently happens is also too complex to determine one way especially on political lines. \n\nEvery character has massive flaws as well as good things within them that lead them to their path. Hey guess what, that’s like every human being here.",This !! No wonder why we only get stupid brainrot sequels in the name of movies. \nPeople like this can't appreciate art and are the epitome of cancel culture
Vishal took the premise of Hamlet and based it in the context of Kashmir. The movie borrows heavily from  ‘Curfewed Night’ by Basharat Peer. You can see the end credits.,Basharat has a cameo in the film as one of the traumatized Kashmiri's when Irrfan and Shraddha's characters meet for the first time.
"It's just f'kin Hamlet. Chill.\n\nIf you can't understand the themes of gratuitous violence, betrayal, and revenge, there's not much point in watching the film. Haider isn't a good guy, he's a guy who got played by his mom and uncle, and Roohdar as well.",I don't think his mother played him. I think she was genuinely in love with kk.
"One of my favorite cinematic experiences, I’m glad I re-read Hamlet before watching. Bhardwaj adapting the mousetrap into Bhismil blew my mind!",Bismil is one of the greatest mousetrap rendition ever to be composed!
"You should stick to Akshay Kumar films if you want, one-dimensional, flat, predictable, simple black and white characters and dumbed-down, jingoistic movies with zero nuance, mature conflicts and complexity. Above all, if you find an artist questioning your preconceived notions offensive, well, maybe consider being a little open-minded and being empathetic. 'Haider'  is a beautiful web of internal and external conflict, something that's not very common in Bollywood. But, you'll need an ounce of empathy to appreciate it.\n\n And addressing your take directly, why wouldn't someone avenge their father's death when they feel that their cause is justified? The film clearly shows the atrocities faced by Kashmiris especially because of AFSPA. It shows his struggle to find his father. It shows him struggling with questions. And finally when he finds the answers, and feels that he was wronged, why wouldn't he avenge it?\n\nAnd finally, you also seemed to miss the main theme, the main point of the film, Haider's grandfather's (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) dialogue which goes something like ""inteqaam se sirf inteqaam paida hota hai""; which loosely translates to, revenge begets revenge. The consequences of revenge is revenge. Revenge is cyclical, never-ending. It's a meta commentary about Haider, as well as Kashmir and Kashmiris, and in today's context, the message is way more relevant for all the parties involved.",Perfectly captured all my thoughts!
"The doctor was not a terrorist/militant. He had a code to follow, which is to not deny treatment for anyone, and that's why he decided to operate on the wounded militant. \n\nHis wife was scared to death, and she confessed to the doctor's brother about what was going on, seeking comfort. The doctor's brother didn't ""call the police"", he flat-out called his brother a terrorist by blowing the car horn on his turn when people were being rounded up under suspicion of terrorist activity, and actively sought out his death. That's where the betrayal lies.\n\nThat's what Haider is avenging. There was nothing to be ""called out"" in the film.","The Uncle, Khurram, brilliantly played by KK Menon, was lustful towards Haider's mother, Tabu. He removed Haider's father from his path of lust. The mother sought the support of a man who could maybe find her husband and chose the uncle because she knew he liked her but didn't know of the breach of trust he had done."
"The fact that you watched Haider and still managed to butcher its meaning is truly impressive.\n it’s an adaptation of Hamlet, a story about betrayal, loss, and existential despair. Vishal Bhardwaj masterfully chose Kashmir because it embodies the very essence of Shakespeare’s tragedy: betrayal by loved ones, exploitation by power structures, and the death of innocence.\nThe movie highlights how ordinary lives are crushed between separatists, militants, and brutal laws like AFSPA. But I guess expecting you to understand layered storytelling, where not everything is black and white, is asking too much.\nStick to Bollywood masala if your brain can’t handle a little complexity.",OP will do morcha and burn posters of Vishal Bhardwaj next week.
"There's a concept called anti-hero. MCs are portrayed in such a way where they don't have morals or ethics or perfect guy qualities like traditional heroes and this makes u route for that character until it ends. For example, Walter White from Breaking Bad, he enters into meth business with good intentions but later the arrogance, inferiority complex, ego took over him, he lets Jane die knowing he could have saved her, gets Gale killed, running meth empire, who knows how many would have died taking those drugs and what not. Still his character is considered one of the GOATs. \n\nIn the context of this post, OP clearly doesn't wanna admire the artistic approach of film that how well it's made, how Shahid nailed/aced this character but instead he wanna shove up his political stand which is unnecessary and at such place where it doesn't belong. Haa kashmir scenario is kinda debatable but doesn't mean u gotta hate it entirely.",Kitna effort daala hai dimwit ko samjhane ko bhai
People like OP are the reason why art and artistic film in general dont have a space in India. People like you deserve brainded bhai movies,"not really. people even say scarface was a good movie, that it wasn't a shitty B movie. the same sort watch haider and call it a masterpiece."

"Now when I look back I remember countless beatings from Teachers just for the sake of discipline. I remember in 4th class our entire class was forced to walk enitre corridor of school with our hands up in the air just to make an example out of us. Our crime? Some kid mumbled something. The entire class was silent, it was just a mumble from an innocent kid and this was the punishment. Fuck that bitch. If someone did this to my children I'll make their life a living hell.\n\n\nEdit: this is not even my worst school experience, it was the oldest I can remember. The worst one happened in 8th class, I was in yoga room sitting on yoga mat and the teacher was trying to keep us silent but no-one was listening, he was behind me speaking to a kid and I said something to the guy next to me, he turned around and kicked me as hard as he can on my back bone. I swear to god I literally thought I will never be able to walk again, I was in so much pain that I was lying on the floor crying and trembling, the yoga teacher then tried to give me some sort of massage but It still took more than a month for me to walk properly again. When my father came to school to complaint about him, he came running and touched feet of my father asking for forgiveness.  He was given a warning and spared (can't remember why my dad didn't take him to court). But a few months later he was fired because he had beaten a kid with a rod so much that the kid got bruces on his body.\n\nEdit 2: I read all the replies, it's really sad how so many of you guys too have traumatizing experiences in the name of discipline or late fees (fuck man! What a child can do if his/her fees is not submitted on time?), but I'm sure we won't let this happen to our future generations. May god bless you.","bruh i was locked inside a dark room with a bunch of other squealing kids in pre primary as a ""punishment"""
Piece of shit teacher,Yep he is a piece of shit. Teachers and parents like these are the cause of millions of children developing low self esteem.
"I remember one instance from my 4th grade.Some kid in my class wrote gadha on our black board while going back home after the last bell rang.Noone noticed the word on the board and left the class without erasing the word.On the next day our class teacher noticed it.And gave us the weirdest solution to catch the kid who did this heinous crime.He told us ki jiske daat katkata (chatter) rahe honge usne ye kiya hoga.It was a fking winter morning in Delhi.While most of us were trying no to chatter our teeth,he chose a kid and beat the shit out of him..And warned him not to do it again.And the kid didn't spit a word even though he had nothing to do with it.His face had turned red due to the constant slapping\n.F you Jasvinder sir.",Why call them sir. You're not a student anymore and they don't deserve it
Hitting and abusing has never done any good to anyone.  \nThe only thing it has created is people with trauma and made people more violent . Yes Idiots its not video games that cause violence it is you people beating children that makes them violent . Good parenting/teaching does not include even touching children,Pitai to mujhe v mili but trauma bilkul nai hai but ab wo teacher mile to ulta pelne ka man karta hai. Haat lagane wala hota kaun hai!
I used  to be in that line for late  fee,"W o t, me privileged hu to ptani. But do they actually hit kids for late fee? What kind of schools do that?"

"Still remember when the entire boys group in our class was beaten with a broken table leg, fucker swung it full force on our asses\n\nReason? Me and my friends came late to PT class because they took me to the doctor because I was sick, so we were beaten as punishment while the others were beaten so that they never repeat the same ""mistake"" as me, good thing my classmates were considerate enough because we all hated the PT teacher, next day went to the principal with my parents to complain about bs punishments, I'm glad this bs stopped for our class, hopefully the other classes got spared from his bs too","Lol i had a\n similar experience, its sad that they beat us up before really understanding or hearing us out.The indian system is really fucked.\n\n\n\nHappy Cake Day btw!!"
Children need love from hugs not from a fucking cane. I hope this generation of parents and teachers dont do this bullshit,When I was a kid I thought getting smacked by adults was normal. Now that I look back at it I see how fucked up it was. Most of them were just taking out their frustration on us. Fuck teachers who beat children!

"Imagine being north american and believing a language called *English* is ""your language"" any more than it is the indians\n\nIt's about as much the Americans language as it is the indians. Both are former British colonies that had the language imported through colonialism.",English is absolutely America’s language. It’s just many other countries language too.
As a European I find American English accent the worst kind of accent for the language.,"Then you have no clue how bad it can get. London accent sounds posh, northern English sounds chav, Scouse is Scouse. My personal favourite is Australian English."

Fire crackers are a Chinese invention. Ye Chinese style me Diwali kyu celebrate karna? Ramayan ke kis adhyay me likha hai ki 14 saal ke vanvaas ke baad Ayodhya me Ram ka swagat fataake jalakar kiya gaya?,"Yes according to scriptures only diyas were lighted. It’s a festival of lights. \n\nBut the marathas popularised firecrackers to make the festival more enjoyable. And over hundreds of years it has become a part of the culture. \n\nNow going back again is simply a vendetta to dismantle the culture by removing whatever has been added to it since. \n\nIf u want everything to stay the same since the time of scriptures then there will be no evolution and we all must simply go back to those times where brahmins appointed Hindu kings n the kings ruled their kingdom, when widows burnt themselves, etc. \n\nAlso the “Hindi” we speak is more than 20 percent Urdu even though originally all the words in Hindi was borrowed from Sanskrit. So now should we start weeding out all the Urdu words from hindi?"

"This makes me wanna commit suicide. No friends, no connections, fuck whores. I just wanted a little bro Or a kid I can take care of. Someone who would do what I couldn't, someone who look upto this flawed man thinking he is perfect, and be the perfect person he/she thinks I am. But here I am. Stuck with the same thing making mistakes, never earning a single rupee in the 18 years I was alive. Dads gonna retire soon, he married late. I'm doing the most overrated course in India, engineering. That also in IT. Lockdown dulled my skills. No matter how much I want I can focus on study again. I feel like I should die. I'm worthless for this world, if my organs could be sold. That fortune will help mom and dad rest. \n\nBut no in just a random ret@rd scrolling reddit. A degenerate who masturbates to hentai once a week. And a loser with no girl friend and ADHD. \n\nI'm possibly going to get downvotes bit fuck it.\n\n\nEdit: These comments did help me a little, I don't think I'll end my life cause I'm a scaredy cat. Thanks for all that such nice words I don't wanna vent anymore, don't wanna already negative vibes. Just frustrated a lil'","No shit bro ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ , your whole story is relatable aff , except the suicide part. Literally the same condition . Try watching some anime , it will genuinely help you and make some new interest that you can perform anywhere without any certain conditions to do it. Create a mindset that "" it doesn't matter if others don't like me , I can enjoy in this world myself"" \n\nEven in this modern world my parents didn't wanted me to study , even tho they make a decent living every month. Somehow I managed to convince them , it took me 4 months of constant hustle to just convince them to allow me to give JEE and go into a college but in these 4 months of hustle I didn't study at all cauz of my mental state. Still somehow they allowed me to give JEE again\n( I said them that I'll commit suicide  but will not live the life you want me to be a part of )\n\nI'm from a family where nobody has any knowledge about mainstream education and nobody ever did any mainstream job . My father is a businessman but he still wanted me to do House-staff job in AFS , since it's a government job but they denied when I said "" I can give exams if airmen too"" , they were too afraid cause of the family history and the mindset that nobody in our family can ever achieve anything without cleaning shoes. My father also use to work at construction sites in his early days. I only have one chance and that's it. If I didn't clear jee next year I'm going homeless. \n\nI also don't have a happy life , my father and I both live in a same home but in last two years we barely talked to each other ( like 2 hours , in complete 2 years ) they like me but still they don't want me to live my life the way I want. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me alive are the dreams that I have . I don't have any freinds , I used to be an extrovert and that average studying class guy , frnds with everybody. But in highschool everything changed , I'm an introvert , no frnds , social anxiety , bad relationship with family . Atleast I have dreams , that's enough for me to live. Don't think about suicide brotha , u have what It takes to live a happy life , just enjoy yourself . Think only about the good moments thatbyou will live if you succeed . \n\nOne day you will be living a good and mentally healthy life  .\n\nI hope this msg would help you and sry for this big reply."

He's not wrong. USA has killed more people on foreign land than Pakistan or any other country,Thats called winning lol
"Yeah, i get it why they have right to think that US are terrorist for them",They took the baton from the previous world record holder - britain.
"For the world : IT Means , Information technology \n\n\nBut for Pakis : International terrorism \n\nSalman Rushdie : Pakistan sucks \n\nHilary Clinton : You don’t have to take this month , while giving aid.\n\nSevere load shedding , unaddressed unemployment , ever raising AIDS , economy is in such a bad situation , even PM s house they rented as function halls , Baloch says , we are not Pakistanis. \n\nThe worlds migraine is Pakistan.",And you Indians drink piss 💀
"Lmao man spitting straight fax though. If you are brown and you've been abroad, there are tons of people that will look at you as if you were a terrorist, whatever your religion may be. This dude is returning that favour for everybody.\n\nLook at it from his point of view. Since 9/11, all Muslims had to do to be considered terrorists in the eyes of countries like the US was simply to exist. The vast majority of them didn't have anything to do with the attack. \n\nBut a significant chunk of the Islamic world faced the consequences of the US attacking Iraq, Afghanistan, stirring up ISIS, destroying their homes, drone striking their countries (thousands killed in Pakistan alone, mostly militants the US would say).\n\nObviously, Pakistan is pretty much world enemy #1 when it comes to creating terrorists. But it's not as ironic as OP would make it out to be. Who knows this guy's background. He's just selling T shirts for fucks sake.\n\n But sadly, 'Pakistan = bad' is our hivemind programming. And we pretend as if terrorism has only one religion. We're not even ready to realise that our terrorists wear shorts.",Lmfao the middle east have been fighting with eachother before North America was even discovered.

I have been using this app for last 3 to 4 years. Recently I have recommended this platform for a total of 7 people. Forcefully made them to install the app  and create an account cos I thought they may enjoy.\n\nAll of them have un-installed the app.,Yup people just hate reddit cause I guess it's like a anti social social media. You don't know who you are talking to. The reddit culture is different and we'll maybe a few people try and get a presence on reddit but they would be restricted to a few subs. However I am already seeing a lot of normie memes on many mainstream subreddit from indians. Like the recent influx of the WW2 one's .I don't know why they always beg for approval from westerners.\n\nJic you guys say that my account is just a few weeks old yeah I have like 10 alts... Cause sometimes I just give out too much info and from fear of getting doxxed just delete that acc
Bro one day down the line reddit will be the mainstream,"It already has become. If you guys use only this sub, u might not know. But if you have been browsing other subs, you will notice how quickly reddit is becoming the next social media. The banning of so many subs in the past few years is an evidence.\n\n Go to the mainstream subs, and you will notice any posts/comments which contradicts their hive mind mentality, are removed and the user gets banned. You don't have to go too far, just see the official Indian sub, and that's only 1 example that I've given you.\n\nReddit was originally started as a forum for free speech. It has now become the epitomy of one sided echo chamber and censorship."
Yes...i dont want it to meet same fate as quora fb etc..,Quora turned into a mixture of boomer Instagram and Yahoo Answers somehow in the span of 2 years

"Yooo that is sooo true. I dont want everyone going around asking usernames and post terrific ""content"" ....","No one will care, that's what I love about reddit. It's all about communities, no point of getting followers and likes here."
please bro reddit is more entertaining then insta at least i don't have to see those cringe reels,Bro that's why don't want reddit become more stream otherwise those people will come here and will start doing same shit... here too. Reddit Is only for people of culture
"same, I also don't want this to happen or else who knows after few years we are seeing all kind of shit in reddit and also claiming that reddit is not good.",We would be disappointed if it becomes like quora too

"It's not shutting down, WB has confirmed, it's just that they have laid off some employees since the ratings of the channel have been touching an all time low, but they are not shutting it down.",The merged entity will collectively be called WB Animation. Pata nahi kaun rumours faila raha hai?
It’s not shutting down exactly \n\n,Bhai warner bros mai merge ho jayega and will not produce the same thing and the same way OG Cartoon Network did it and might get completely renamed & handover to different franchise.

Pee used to go upwards before he created gravity,Can clean his face anywhere
It is known that was notoriously horny.  Newton always awoke with a boner. As we all know boner piss is notorious for breaking the laws of gravity. Read a book.,"What! So you mean to say that for thousands of days, he woke up everyday with a boner and had it for **24 hours for thousands of days**. And everytime, he went to pee, he would paint the whole bathroom with his anti-gravity boner pee. Also, not to forget, even after being horny his whole life, he died unmarried and a virgin! Damn, this is an even weirder theory than flat earth, my god!"
"When Kamedians on Reddit don't realise that The Apple was a Biblical metaphor directed towards the Roman Catholic Church, which was a staunch suppressor of science at that point of time. \n(I know this one is a joke, but this same joke has been used, reused and has turned into a bitter lime over a period of Hundreds of years)",I think many people know that it's not just because of the apple that Newton started thinking of gravity. It's just a make believe story.
"if apple falls to earth, why doesn't the moon fall?",Jaake Science of Stupid dekh chhote
We should be happy it was not a coconut,Hope you do well!
At least credit the one who has made this meme and don't be a karma whore on other's work.,R u sure?\n\nIma check u/repostsleuthbot
Fuck Newton and his asshole theories,**frustrations from a disgrace art student**

"I'm straight and Henry Cavill makes me question my orientation sometimes, that's how fucking hot he is. How in the world he lost the title to this guy is beyond me.","Sometimes i giggle like a schoolgirl when seeing him, he is just ridiculous attractive, saying this as a straight male.\n\nAbout this title though i read that it's bogus, the competition isn't decided until December so this is just a hoax."
I respect Henry Cavill because his physique looks legitimately natural. Unlike some actors.,Because he is natural

Jus saying it's a trend \nI might sound a bit racist for this(belive me this is not intentional) but I think this entire East Asian hype is nothing but a trend everything from their looks and their culture is glorified(ngl theyre pretty but sum people go overboard with it)\nThis East Asian hype has made its way into fashion and streetwear too which is jus another sign that this trend is not going to die anytime soon,"It's not bad to try different things. The reason for the hype is rooted in boredom. If Indian folks don't want to try out foreign trends, then maybe Indians would need to up their game, make trendy things that are actually uplifting. I like BTS's music and they are very dear to me, as silly as it sounds, their content on the internet helped me feel lot less lonely."

I still remember how my father tortured me into getting good marks in tenth class. He told everyone in the neighborhood , relatives , friends that I will score the maximum gpa (10points).. he kept me under lot of pressure that I had to study everyday under very stress to get that marks. I even had suicidal thoughts that time ..he use to say everyday that ""ive said everyone that u will get good marks..now don't make me put my head down'' this line haunted me for months... well I know I get good marks if I study well but still that was all unnecessary pressure. At last I somehow got what he wanted and made sure from the start that this shitty thing doesn't happen in class 11th and 12th.."

"I remember, in my French class, we had a party where we could bring our own traditional food. I had an African friend who brought some traditional African snacks. They were like idli, but had peanuts and were spiced. The dipping was also a bit spicy, but not that much. Everyone else brought junk food and one white girl tried his snack. I swear she started jumping up and down screaming that the African boy had killed her tongue. She went out of the class to drink some water and you could see the boy was feeling bad. Because no one else tried his food.  I felt for him, so I ate all of his snacks, praising his mom's cooking, so he got cheered up.

i have this idea of a parody of making an action movie where the director does not understand the concept of stunts and special effects and people actually die.  it deteriorates into a reality tv police investigation.  the police force the director to hire a particular lawyer because they trust him to negotiate a bribe.  the whole thing is ruled an accident.  the problem is that there is no resolution at the end.  there is acceptance of truth of our society.,Alec Baldwin likes this

Someone tell me why this guy gets all the accolades while Constitution drafting committee had 5 members,At the time maybe 99% of dalits were rolling around in tatti so it was a pretty big deal
Accidental? That's what the brahmanical patriarchy wants you to think,I have heard that term being used unironically so many times its ridiculous. Literally kuch bhi.
Repost,Maaf kijiye janaab. I didn't know.
"Read about his work - was forced to, spread across 4 semesters. Sure, physics cannot be equated with social sciences. The constitution was a work of the drafting committee and if any overarching credit was due for its work - it was for B.N. Rao, not Ambedkar. If the credit towards upliftment and empowerment of a certain section of the society, without a doubt, great work! But if you’re claiming he was scholar and ahead of his times in terms of his thought process - average.","BN Rao was an eminent jurist who was an advisor to the constituent assembly.  He wrote the first draft of the Constitution. Yeah,  he was a dude.  But saying Ambedkar who  was a great multi/ interdisciplinary mind,  an expert on several subjects ranging from Economics,  law, political theory as well as the mechanics of religion & society about which he wrote several books, besides being a full time political. Comparing him to your ass simply because you can type is head up ass 101"
". A seriously brilliant meme. Funny, risque, historical. That said Ambedkar was a fricking genius.  Salute & Jai Bheem!","genius my ass, his academical record was sub-par, nothing extraordinary like a CV Raman or Dr. Kalam."
Bcuz of him we are suffering today,Ambedkar did a lot of good for the country but at the same time after actually reading his shit I feel like he genuinely hated Hindu culture and upper castes kek.

That's just impossible, lmao.   \nLion and Tigers could break your neck without even trying or giving a fuck. Whether you are 7 foot extremely built guy, a lion/tiger could maul you for fun. The only way I see a human taking on a lion/tiger and winning is via weapons, and even then, you'll probably succumb to the injuries (given the weapon is short-ranged). Only a skilled man with a decent short-range weapon would have some chance, and that as well, I'm not sure.",No there are men who can fight 😠🤜🐅

People pirate webseries and movies in a single day from OTT this is not a matter of availability its a matter of morality,"morals are subjective, some people may think gali dena is ok but for some its morally wrong or some may think killing  animals for consumption is bad but for some its just source of their protein, if you think the show is immoral just dont watch or criticize but f\*\*ck it just became the national issue man despite there are  infinitely genuine problems in our country"

Lyrics coming up with the supersonic sped.,"Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?\n\n#YES I DID COPY PASTE THIS WHY DO YOU ASK"

"Im a hindu and i believe in adwaita siddhantha, so just one "" Paramathma""","Parmatma or Brahman is well, Everything. It makes up everything. The Gods, You, Me, a chair are all are its part. But we do not worship a chair. We worship those Manifestations of Brahman which we consider 'divine'. Like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti etc. \n\nBecause Brahman is Everything. Its the good but its also the Evil. Its Dharma but its also Adharma. Hence its an entity. Not a God. Say like a Universe. And Everything is else is a part of it but some energies of the Universe are greater than others and hence the God_s_ thing.\n\nParmatma is ofcourse there. Its Everything. Its supreme. But not to be worshipped. Its not a God."

Tbh Dank rishu and saiman's roast made so much more sense than his...,Carry’s roasts are just straight up bad words. Koi sense bhi nahi hain. Lekin public ko yeh hi chahiye. We can’t do anything to promote saiman and saysena
I'm ngl but roasting style of Saiman and Carry are quite different and comparing both their videos is quite not of any use. Just because Saiman doesn't use cussing shouldn't imply that Carry shouldn't use any cuss words. His earlier roasting videos are like this and it's not new for him to shout and use cuss words like roasting. So I don't get this unnecessary hate for Carry. I mean ya most of his fanbase is filled with normies but doesn't mean he makes bad content all the time.,LOL XD mai kaise maan Lu.... Ab mat maan mat bol...
Carry ki VDO me mujhe kuchh chij bekar lagi\n\nEk toh bodyshaming ko justify Kia \n\nAur comments me like ki bhik mangne ko mana Karke khud 2M likes Ka aim Kar Raha hai \n\nAur sirf Gali bakke chilaya \n\nOkk uska hater Nahi but Kuch Kuch lines acche the,This new video was sorta okay imo. It actually made me exhale a few times.
"to be honest, i liked saiman's roast so much more, carryminati literally just screamed cuss words at that guy without taking crossing the stupid points that tik toker made.",I even liked slayy point's roast better
Abey Saiman reacted to his video not roasted. Roast and react are 2 different stuff. Understand the difference,"Dude , sitting behind a camera is not a roast be it saiman or carry or whoever . People in India don't understand the meaning of roast . Roast is what Comedy Central does or what AIB did in 2015 ."
"Dude literally twitter , insta is flooded by carryminati's latest videos memes and appreciation posts by his up/bihari koi janta, dank rishus roast was most sensible followed by saimans video these real gems getting over shadowed just like good content on tiktok gets covered by cringe content","Dank rishu was spitting out facts that was not a roast, but what carry did was roast."
Carry is soo overrated in Indian chapri nibba community. Carry shits- bwahahahaga\nOthers make better video- carry bhai ko copy krta h\n\n🙂,i said bhenchod now laugh
Dank Rishu's was so much better,"Bruh, that wasn't a roast, but carry's video is a roast, you see there's a difference"

"Genuinely curious , how can these guys think of recording such things on camera and then put it on internet and let the whole world watch it . I am not against vlogging and I understand its concept . But recording moments like this where the person is in some trouble / they see some trouble , what comes to their mind  that they pick up the camera and start recording these things, its not required to show these things in front of the whole world.Such vlogging seems really fake and feels like it has been done purposefully for views. Lmao I wouldn’t think of vlogging my kids crying and all.",Its all the game for views/money/fame. He knows seeing rashi vulnerable will get him instant clicks so puts up a thumbnail of her crying. Next he adds that video randomly at exactly 10 min mark for the watchtime and boom  he gets what he wants
and you are giving them views,he might get a view but not the video impression and watch time ig . Anyways he's not getting a penny from my view

"By the last season GOT used to have an average budget of 15 million USD per episode for about 1 hour of footage. From whta I have heard this movie has budget of 500cr INR with is about 60 million USD for lets say 3 hours of footage.

Butterfly effect: there is more,"we wouldn't be here, talking on reddit if that happened"
"If people are thinking India was changed because of britain, they are absolutely true but hear me out.\nBefore britain came mughals were already weak and marathas were getting stronger, india was already a rich country and it could grow even more. Its education system was far better than the British education system . So even if british wasnt there we could have developed. Only problem would be that india would be a hindu rashtra instead of a secular nation, apart from that, india would be developed\n\n\nHappy Independence Day btw","I mean, even if it had become hindu rashtra that time, it doesn't mean that other religions would not be allowed here.

If this could be possible then the ss textbooks would have been way to thinner. It would have been amazing!!!,India still has a lot more history without british.

"They already made airplane moving faster than any rocket ""nasa"" ""scientists""(two of their favourite words"" ever made /s",Mars pe jaane ka rocket vedas mei hai pr jab koi scientist banayega tab pta chalegi hume
"Heard an interesting take from some leftist politician, that if Vedas have everything mentioned, then why don't they showup before someone discovers/invents that.","That's not an interesting take, it's just common sense"
"U are Hinduphobic 😡 why are u talking shit about our ancient vedas? In ramayana ravan had helicopter, in mahabharata out lord Krishna could stop time and they had nuclear weapons. Afterall Hinduism is all about science which westerners stole from us 🤡. Why don't u talk about quran or bible? they said earth is flat whereas aryabhatta inverted zero(feeling proud Indian army) /s",acha hai end me /s dekh liya
"It's about how religious text or Vedas don't give proper definitions. It's always vague. So that most of the time they're true. They're just like star signs. Give vague explanation, so that you're never wrong","You're right mudiji. And another reason for that is Vedas were written in Sanskrit, and one word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings. Because of this property of Sanskrit people can get confused and even intentionally change the real meanings of words while translating it."

I really want these girls to go to Korea just so they can realise how ridiculous korea beauty standards are. They would face racism beyond belief.,They r just children admiring a band team. I don't know why u guys r  trolling anything that u see in ur eyes. When they were grown up they will know the world till that allow them to have  a happy life.
No need ...they will kill themselves when they come to know how Koreans treat black bts army.,I was about to say this
"Bro jo rejection milega na waha, meri cousin sister is there working in samsung and wo indian standard se kafi jyada pretty hai and height bhi 5'7 hai, fair hai and also good physique so in india she is like legit 'bawaal' but waha she told k men/women/old people called her 'you smell like curry' even she is putting 12k ke perfume and she doesn't eat curry and also got called brown monkey, most korean men just wanted to fuck her and nothing more and that too in guise of clappin some foreign pussy, she got attention but mostly negative and and she said koreans are very racist as india me they don't get too onto you while insulting but koreans will get too pushy with things, some old men tried to grope her too in guise that she is foreigner and just asking for it, at some point she stopped going out at night as she believed she will end up like some korean murder mystery movie character.\n\nKoreans calling her smell like curry is just all the time and its their way of attacking to put you down and once she said you smell like kimchi, she was almost assaulted so yeah korean ain't very nice and there are too many stories, if you are white or american or any colour you are kinda fetisized there but brown people specially indians are treated very badly, she said her friends who are bit dark are insulted more and not even approached by korean men, not even once.","Sorry to hear about your sis, would suggest her to return or work in another country, she already gained work exp in Korea so better leave that shit hole. \n\nBas BTS BTS bakchodi karte rehte yeh sab bc phir waha Jake reality dikhti tab rona aajata.\nCorona chala gya but BTS virus nahi gaya sadly."

Amir Siddiqui was roasted so much last year and got so much hate but still he took it and now even congratulated Saiman. Giga chad for me.,"Yes, He gained somewhat respect inside me even if I disliked him so much in past (ex carry fan everybody, I stopped watching carry after yalgaar coz I believed saiman was getting unnecessary hate because of him while he was on nowhere wrong, that kinda pissed me off . I didn't hate carry even then but just stopped following him)\n\nKinda ironic because saiman's video kinda pissed me off as well(really),but it just took me few time to catch that he was right .\n\n\nNobody deserves to be hated this much just because he talked dumb trash about something . He got too much unnecessary hate by curry fans"
When sourav joshi says saiman says dekha kar but doesn't himself congratulate you for 1 million and jalane ke liye top youtubers ki congratulations video daalde apne 10 million hone pr,Every overrated youtuber in Souray joshi's video be like: Behen ke laude ko wish kar deta hu phir collab kar kar ke usko degrade kar dunga
I remember hating him so much \nBut now this guy has become a chad,"Hes the only tiktoker we cool with. Seriously saying this, I loved the way he dealt all the hate he got after the carryminati roast and stuff, he deserves all the appreciation and respect for being like that. Truly a great guy"
Slaypoint🤡 Mythpat🤡.,"Yeah dude, I was wondering why still there are not uploading any congratulations stories, I guess they just sent the msg to saiman as cngrs saiman for 1m subs ..party bro..."
Rg bucket list congratulated him too,And they say saiman is underrated.
"Saiman need to have 10m but instead he had 1m, but I'm sab because even his youtubers friends didn't appreciated him for 1m subs, instead they appreciated sourav 😩, so that they can promote they channel using him ..",Saapo se bhara pura ye samandar

So south Indians ain't black? cuz they be using the n word like there's no tomorrow.,If they learned **Marathi** Subject till 10th
"I am a fair skinned indian and don't have the typical indian features but, but my parents are from u.p and bihar. I am studying in a international American school in uae, and all the American teachers have that racist inline when I say I am from india. ""Your not ""that"" type of indian"" is what they all have said. Like dude, indians are fucking 1.2 billion people. We come in all shape and sizes. Jsut because your idiotic, demented, retarded brain can't comprehend such a simple concept is your fault.",Lmao this is so accurate I'm fair skinned too. Once I was in a video call with some of my German friends and they went oh you don't look Indian you look like someone from Ukraine or Turkey.
I don't understand why we chose opposing skin colors for different races. White people aren't white and black people aren't black. We have two polar opposite color descriptions for races that are both inaccurate. I have my theories.,They even call aliens gray or green \n\nLike wtf Americans haven't you guys seen P.K.
"not true, I seen some french / spanish / german looking Indian girls that have really white skin, nobody would believe they are India Indian hahaha. They are usually the Aryan northern race type of Indians, some are actually whiter than a handful of europeans...",You believe in Aryan superiority??
Indian people are Caucasian no matter what their skin color is,Indians are not caucasian

"Vilgax never lost the hope to beat ben 10. I respect his dedication, just doing everything in his power to beat Ben. He was the thanos for us.",Yes man he was the big bad of ben 10 universe and he was like thanos to us he always gave a tough fight and was actually too dedicated to get the omnitrix .
Unpopular opinion: Omniverse was also very good. Just the animation was off-putting.,But the character of Vilgax had been destroyed in that series. Vilgax was known for being the toughest opponent of ben at times and captured the omnitrix twice! But sadly omniverse failed to potray that type of vilgax :(

'And then there were none' and the episode following that 'and then there was Ben' were one of the best episodes of the series. That and 'A New Dawn',There is a yt channel who has uploaded every episode in hd quality. In a playlist. Some good days man
Bhai Ben 10 is like legendary show..It has span 4 season with different writer villans and Aliens. Chota Bheem used to be good but no way does it writing reach level of Ben10.,Ben 10 (except the reebot obvio)is actually a legendary show without any doubt because its made up of lore even though as children we did not get the lore in depth but it is written in such a way that all things add up at the end whereas chota bheem consists singular episodes with same boring story and the thing is that we all as children experienced ben 10 as an character with his personality evolving  that makes us attavhed to the character;)
Is the Ben10 recap from Kuro the artist or did you actually gather images from all over the series?,I love kuro been watching him from the start of his original series breakdown

"one of the major reasons why the cartoon animation industry of India is so bad is because , they don't give a shit about quality , they only care about quantity. These ad companies won't make 10 different commercials so they make one which is really good","Quantity bhi kaha bhai, ek episode to pura din chalate hai, the fact is that what they produce is garbage"
"Meanwhile Indian cartoons with cancerous 3d Animations.\n\n I really hate Motu Patlu kind of animations, those texture and graphics is irritating",They literally use the same model to create different characters and background walkers like it's hilarious to see motu patlu talking to chaiwala and at the same time the same model of the chaiwala walking in the background
"well, the cartoon industry made that ad too but I understand. Basically, it depends on a lot of things including production and audience. if the audience (currently young kids for example) stops watching those shows they would have to reinvent and make good animations like these ads. but the audience is watching and hence shitty animation. \n\nAnd the production of those shitty animations is easy because the story has almost the same plots and kids are not emailing them to improve like in other cases.\n\nlike animators and people making attack on titans said that they used to get serious threat and criticism and even in recent cases death threats on when an episode or animation sucks. \n\nhere we don't give them feedback. like no one is complaining via email and demanding a good show. The animators working there know that this is bs but if they can get away with easy plot and get paid for it then why would they innovate right...?\n\nsry for bad eng","This is a well written point and yes , no kid will ever write them an email giving criticism to them but they should get criticism ,threats are too much but they should get critisized but I don't think it will change anything , kids will still watch those cartoons ,but I hope in the near future their will be more and more cartoons which are made for a more mature audience , say teen or maybe even adult are released and made here , the number of people who want to see good animation and anime is increasing in india , who knows , maybe one of us will actually take steps and create good animations , we already have some studios trying including studio Durga who released the first Indian anime"

andhadhun dekhte samay mai bhul gya ki bollywood dekh rha hoon. cuz end tak suspense tha movie. and some good characters too not just one dimensional ppl,ha bohot achi movie hai one of the best by bollywood so far that actor is also good most of his movies are good

"Each movie has it's own place in Industry.. everyone have their own tastes.. Be it a masterpiece Cinema or Action, Comedy movies.. everything should be appreciated. Movies are media which can be used to influence, entertain, educate masses so let it be movies like Jai Bhim, Omerta to educate people, Be it ZNMD, 3 Idiots like movies to Influence people or Movies like Sooryavanshi, Golmaal to Entertain people.. So accept it and watch movies according to your mood, if you want stress relief watch light hearted over the top movies..  Don't Expect all movies to be great and to have logic..",The Problem Lies When Jury Sends Movies Like Gully Boy To Oscars And Denies Sardar Udham
"While everyone is fighting\nI would like to promote Karnan,\nVery nice movie",Yea looks like art movies are loved  in majority ( in comment section)
"To be fair I think both the movies play an important part of our Industry. For example people like fictious commercial films as it is a way to escape their tough life and give it a break and feel light hearted or stress free for some time . But this does not mean a film like Sooryavanshi is better than Sardar Udham . I just mean to say you won't go on a weekend night with your family and watch a movie as serious as Sardar Udham , you would rather watch a commercial movie like Sooryavanshi at that time . Sardar Udham is a film you would rather watch alone. But ofc the commercial films are degrading day by day by using the same 10 yr old trope , with fake looking VFX and action scenes , Majority of budget being spent on actors and stupid ass songs out of which most are remakes so in summary our Film Industry is Screwed .",yes true i am not stopping people from watching sooryavanshi but take some time and watch sardar udham as well
Sardar udham was a masterpiece!,On the levels of Schindlers list
While Watching Jai Bhim I Was Like Damn That's So Cruel Thing They Did To An Innocent Man....... But When I Saw The Ending Said That It Was A True Story..... Meri Fatt Ke Chaar Ho Gayi,"Bhai, Mein jab South mein rehta tha, tab ek lower cast wale bande ko beech maidaan mein 30 or 40 logon ne boht maara. Banda marne ki haalat mein tha. Reason was ke he loved a girl joh upper caste ki thi."

Natraj kachchi hoti hai,Natraj color scheme looks dull and ugly (black and red) and wood quality doesn't feel good and they're not smooth. Apsara and Doms way better.

"I hate to be this type of person but people take memes too literally these days so lets understand the ranking system  with a single statement otherwise students would say ""Papa IIT toh bekar hai MIT me daalo mujhe apni FD tod ke""\nThese rankings give a high weightage to abroad students for a particular university aur apne yaha toh apne liye hii jagah nahi hai","Bhai agar teko MIT me mil rha h, to FD todna chhod, loan Lena bhi jayaz h. aur vaise bhi MIT acchi khaasi financial aid deti hai.\n\nalso if you go to csrankings.org vo log sirf research ke basis par rankings karte hai, no other factor, vaha pe bhi iisc top maarta h. aur voh bhi kuch 150+ rank pe hai. at par with mid American universities. so we need to really improve the education in india."

Irony is they hate women who wear burqa and support a woman who's liberated. Such an irony.,"What does clothing have to do with this? It's just rich families protecting their criminals..If that girl came from a poor background, she would have been lynched on the spot..Clothing has nothing to do with it"

WOOOOOOOOOO THAT'S SO GREAT. I hope they treat her just like they treated arshad after realizing they can milk him for some reputation. I mean they are not getting a single reputation out of it but arshad did get a lot of benefits It's better than letting the crooks get everything tho.,Olympics is not comparable to this event
Why's she crying? Did they beat her??,u stupid dum dum
After what happened to that kid in Faisalabad. I fully support their actions. \n[Context ](,"This was more brutal than what I've seen in movies, he just died like that?! May Allah forgive him and grant him jannat ul firdous, he didn't deserve such a brutal death like that......govt should legit ban kites cuz our awaam doesn't care about others"
"Should everybody do this?\n\nGenuine question, I want to but am conflicted as to whether it is morally correct or no",You would save someone's life
I personally feel like flying a kite is not the problem. Infact ban of Basant is also not a solution. The problem lies with how we celebrate this event or social activity. First of people should fly kites only kn in open areas like parks & secondly the string being used should be a normal one & anyone manufacturing the dangerous strings should be hanged to death.,"It's not only in festive season. And it's mostly kids that do this especially in other seasons. Humans, wildlife, infrastructure all suffer from kites."
Rather than educating those children about the dangers of kite flying people will just tear every kite they see and don't even recompensate the money used to buy the kites. \n\nVery Pakistani behavior.,"Exactly, Instead of tearing that kite up, He should've let them be until they kill someone."
"I don’t understand, were they about to do some dangerous stunt with the kites?",so proir to this there was an incident including a kite twine causing a motorbike driver's death and this man saw a kite and got angry so he destroyed it. sorry for my bad englanddd

"Siddig Jaan made a good point on one of his coverages (he is a bit annoying but his court reporting is top notch).\nRegarding the morale of the police being extremely down: \n\n1. Most police are not that corrupt, these are salaried folks and things are as tuff for them as it is for most people with inflation. They do as much corruption as normal people do all the time. They are not all Gullu Butts. majority agree with protestors and want to see Imran and PTI succeed\n2. They can't get out of the house with their uniform on without people verbally abusing them. They feel eyes on them all the time \n3. They have been overstretched, overworked with all the raids and arrests, they don't want to actually do that but have to follow orders. Nowadays some are in duty most hours of the day. \n4. They die in the line of duty all the time. Terrorist attacks, polio escorts, kacche ke daaku. SPs and IG put them out as cannon fodder but when they die, they are not called shaheed, there are no specially honours, even people here on this sub think they got what they deserve \n5. Just look at your local sipahi, does he / she look like they are on the inner circle? They are just like front line Faujis, do as they are told","So the same excuse as the German soldiers used after ww2 or USA soldiers after Vietnam? That every person in power or anyone with a little authority uses,\n\n ""the guys upstairs are doing it too, so what's the harm in me doing it at a smaller scale?"" Or ""it was the orders, I had to kill/rape/arrest/beat them or I would be fired or be done the same to me, so better them than me.""\n\nNo ethics? No moral? What about hereafter? What about haram or Halal kamai? They are paid from my taxes, i earn halal money, why should they be allowed to earn my halal money as haram? They can resign and get another \nJob, which they can't.

Iron dome - error 404,lol I like this
Iron dome is made for short range rockets or artillery.\n\nIsrael have other systems for ballistic missiles that are david's sling and Arrow system. (Idk about their success rate),The arrow system was definitely used but apparently it is extremely expensive and for the financial year 2023 US made only 12.
Israel learns that iron can’t stand against a missile.,Iron dome was never supposed to shoot down ballistic missiles. It's used for smaller non guided rockets and drones.
"Seems like a trap. Israel deliberately let the missiles hit,to later use it as an excuse to attack Iran","Not necessarily, although quite a possibility.\nThe Iron Dome or any type of defense system will not be able to intercept high speed big missiles. They only are effective with smaller slower moving missiles like the ones Hamas and Hezbollah send. Even last April when Iran sent a drone Barrage towards israel, they also sent a few ballistic missiles and while most of the drones got intercepted, very few missiles were intercepted. Also, Iran reportedly used some of its hypersonic missiles and if you look at the speed at which those came in, you will understand why they weren't able to intercept them."
"Iron dome is for short range missiles, Barat 8 and Arrow series (similar to American Patriot) is for long range ballistic missiles though it's yet to be seen how successful it was.","I have seen some reports that 90% of the missiles had reached the target without interception and hit An israeli airbase and port, Some reports claim that some F35's have been destroyed, But thats just we heard"
In exactly 2 weeks they will be crying all over social media,"First they denied that missiles hit successfully,\nThen they started crying like ""We are victims😭😭Terrorist attack""\nNow they gonna ask for aid,\nBiden and west gonna give him billions of tax payer money, Then they gonna drop those bombs on civilians, Commit war crimes, And other muslim countries will just sit back and watch\nAnd the cycle still goes on"
Nashrallah is still dead ☠️ tho 🤣,was this supposed to be a joke ?
Risking nuclear retaliation on your country for another country,"Iran's been attacked by Israel (both openly and covertly) multiple times in the past year alone, what are you on about?"
Ye kia patakhay jaisi koi cheez hain,Yes in patakho ko Pakistan mai sumbhal k rakha jata hy.. Iran ne use kar lia.. In patakho ko ballistic missiles b kehty hain
"But why are you guys acting like Israel cant flatten Iran. Theyre literally backed by the US, dont be dumb","Nobody is arguing the US can't flatten Iran.  \n\nIf the US stopped sending them aid and weapons today, Israel would be utterly fccked inside of a week."

People like her can't stop showing off how cool they look while holding on to their expensive phones all while they sip their expensive coffee (which ofcourse is to give off angrezi vibes).. They aren't doing this job for the sake of it rather for the glamour and status that comes attached with it\n\nI am pretty sure she uploads pictures on her Instagram, working behind her desk with a random shair (which she has no idea what it means) as the caption","Aap k paas tu na smart phone hay aur naa aap ne kbhi motorway se is trha k cup me chai/coffee li hay. \n\nHer tone and attitude shows authority because guess what? She is in a position of authority. She is explaining to them that they need to complete a list, thats her job. Ffs women cannot act like they have authority even when they have earned it on merit."
Why dont our people fight back,"See the police behind her? and knowing punjab police's record, not a good idea.\n\nPeople are generally cooperative and kind. Unless you're a CSS officer, then you can act like a god."
Why are these kids getting senior political positions?,"They're not kids, we're getting older lol"
"This nation is just stuck in little problems everywhere. These attitude problems are everywhere in our society, yet all we do is blame someone else for several problems.

"Beta kis ko bol rahi hai ye gandi bachi, is this how it is in Pakistan?? \nWe have it better in the west!","No, you do not..?? 😅\n\nThe West is lucky that the English language does not have Honorific Pronouns.\n\nLike, in urdu, there's like 3 ways to refer to ""You"" in English there's only one, and it's like that in so many other cases. \n\nIf English was as complex as Urdu, that you could infer the mindset of someone by their words, we would find so much hate and superiority complexes there, it would be crazy."

Serious answer if anyone was wondering:\n\nMedals are awarded for campaigns and lengthy deployments. Not wars won. \n\nExample: \n9 months away from home/family in - tent in Siachin - medal,Thousands of soldiers around the world wear Afghanistan service medals… and we all know how that war ended
I think most of them are awarded after completing courses.,Courses:\n\n- Installing secret camera in bedroom \n- recording phone calls\n- propaganda song writing\n- propaganda film writing\n- abducting effectively\n- controlling judiciary\n- illusion of elections \n- plotting against the awam\n- crushing IK

Just FYI, I didn't refer to any specific one as there are multiple videos of him & all of them are pure gold.\n\nI started with this one:\n\n","Interesting, can you provide the link, I want to watch as well."

Saw this uploaded by an Indian YouTuber. Kudos to OP for spreading indian narrative further,"Indians don't have the capacity for such dank memes when it comes to Pakistan, he must have taken it from a Pakistani source.\n\nThe most they can do is ""Wow, this Pakistani is cute, I will offer atta (flour)"".\n\nBesides I don't think your average Indian is aware of K-E or the stereotypes associated with the different major Pakistani cities, or Rooh Afza."
Indians cannot leave a stone unturned when it comes to demeaning Pakistan and Islam.,Yeah like both PMIK quotes when he didn't even say that. Some ppl actually believe that saying that was against rape victims but srsly?
"That sheir has a face of a rat?\n\nAs a Patwari, I find it very offensive...","That is Cheetah, not a lion. It even says so."
thier obsession with Pakistan is so creepy.

I kinda feel bad sometimes because they know more about my country than I do,You're assuming what they say about your country is true though. 99% of Indian knowledge about Pakistan is quite literally fake news.

Qoran is a false book. It says earth 🌎 is flat 🙄 \n\nAnd still muslims can't correct it,"If you seriously believe that as the truth, your brain needs to be studied. This claim has been destroyed way before. If you ever saw an actual translation of these verses or a genuine video, you wouldnt be blabbering such things with such confidence."
Quran didn't say that if so prove it,"I think it's more to do with many so called Islamic clerics speaking about women staying at home , closing down of schools for girls by taliban etc."

"According to a report published in Deutsche Welle (DW) Hindi, a professor from Punjab University, Rajiv Lochan, in conversation with DW said, “On May 22, 1947, Jinnah was the first person to talk about the corridor between West and East Pakistan. He said it in his reply to a journalist from a news agency, Reuters. The journalist from Reuters asked Jinnah if he thinks India should provide a corridor between Pakistan and India for roadways. Jinnah gave an affirmative response. However, he did not discuss it with the Congress leaders in any official meeting.”\n\nThe report further says, “In June 1947, the British Government said that Indians should show great heroism and provide the corridor to Pakistan. At that time, from the Congress side, leader C. Rajagopalachari had completely rejected this demand. Talking with a news agency, Associate Press, Rajagopalachari called it a completely unnecessary demand, which will not be discussed. Nehru too outrightly rejected this demand of Jinnah. Gandhi was not involved in this entire debate. After Nehru and Rajagopalachari rejected this demand, this topic never came to Gandhi’s notice. Gandhi never made any statement regarding this demand. The Nizam of Hyderabad, who happened to be a supporter of Jinnah, called this demand immature.",Damn! In a world of a billion languages you chose to speak facts! Thank you. :)

"I may be wrong, but I’d be super mad if a bunch of idiots catcalled me. I may not react, but I’ll definitely escape from there because it’s not funny.","then , why is she happy here ??"
,Yahi best comment h
Both are wrong. Upvote if agreed,It's not about what you think is wrong. The point is women  bais of what they call catcalling and what they don't
"Now everyone is saying ""foreigners hai isliye koi kuch nahi keh Raha warna indian hota toh case lag jata "".For them,hum indians ko boundary respect karna aata hai? yeh bhi toh dekh lo ,agar koi sundar ladki dikh Jaye toh approach kaise karte hai woh bhi nahi aata maximum logo ko , appreciate toh dur ki baat .Pehle scene me woh log badtameezi nahi kar rahe ,poora appreciate kar rahe hai ,mere bhi female friends hai ,jab woh bhi ban than kar aati hai ,me bhi appreciate karta hu par boundaries ko respect karke aur even majaak me bol bhi dete hai ""makeup me bohut time laga diya lagta hai?""\n\nDusre scene me use eve teasing kahte hai aur hindi bhasha me ladki cherna joh india ke maximum londe karte hai jinhe ladki se baat karne ki tameez nahi hai aur bas talpade jaise harkate karte rehte hai",Fun fact - This whole line- If a men is ugly his approach is creepy or he is cat calling and if men is attractive then it's flirting even if done in same way. Even if he was staring then he is secret admirer. This whole line is said by white men themself. Not indians. So try again but women do have bais of what they call creeps dn flirting which is dependent of attractiveness

Are you guys realising that she is in a way making fun of his job right? Both Zomato & Swiggy give the facility to tip the delivery guy if you like his service. But she decided to record him while trying to give him money. Won't that guy become embarrassed taking the money while someone is recording him in the act? This is clearly disrespectful. Pathetic woman,Guys in India are just treated that way if they are doing jobs like delivery or group D jobs in the govt or private sector. People like her think flashing money in front of a camera gives her the right to treat a person like this and giving him some nonsense victory over the next person facing probably the same BS in life.

That guy on chair is chill af. People has to be like that if things like this happen. Unfortunately there's lot of white knights these days who'll support women regardless of their mistake.,This is so true. You're too kind to be using the term white knights - those folks are hands-down the worst simps ever!
Them Russians take gender equality seriously,I admire the woman taking a second to think about her actions and the fact that that slap would have knocked me out. Then I wondered about how an American woman would handle this situation.
Bro. Imagine if he closed his fist.,This would just quickly Segway into the pallbearer gif
I am actually impressed. She took that punch well. Nice chin.,"Yeah, despite her starting it, she took that punch pretty well."
"I think it's not false r*pe vs a proper case. People without influence/Power/money get screwed by the system. Injustice affects us all. I don't think this is a men vs women issue. No one here condones assaults, but we don't want innocent people to go to jail and have their lives ruined. Not just their life, the lives of their families as well. The ideal case would be if the crime never occurred. Let's not fight over who gets screwed more by the system. Let's all work together here. Let's make this a place where we figure out how to solve the problem.",THERE IS A VISIBLE DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN IN THE LAW bro... If you are blind against that.. Then you can say whatever you want. \n\n>Let's not fight over who gets screwed more by the system.< \n \nYeah.. Just ignore like that. Hope it will give you good someday. 👌
"Because false rape cases are usually charged on someone who is financially weak and does not have political connection. They can get framed easily and nobody cares about them.\n\nBut actual rapists come from wealthy political families, even police wouldn't file an FIR before telling the rapsits that their victim has come to lodge a complaint. Disgusting country.","THIS!!\n\nAnd it's not just in this country, it's in every underdeveloped or developing country, even developed too"
"Those Who Files false Rape cases Shall be punished no matter what their age/maturity level is. There are many cases of such incidents happening and after many years they agree they filed a fake case against men. Yet, the courts or the government or the so-called social activist morons never give their attention to such issues. The humiliation, anger, frustration and depression and all other losses happened to the victim - men are never considered and never given a proper closure. \n\n At least 10 years of imprisonment with fine shall be charged against such fake allegations and the identity of the women who made fake complaints shall be revealed. Only such actions will prevent this issue.","Main problem is that, if its a middle class man/poor man vs false accusations,  she should be punished, I say even more than 10 years.\n\nBut if its a political person, Idk, as Indian judiciary will actually make a real case a false case and now the person who's already suffered a lot has to suffer even more"
"The need of the hour is to arrest and jail the women who file False rape cases, false 498A and DV cases. This shyt need to be criminalized.  These women are getting away with out any punishment even if it proved that the case is a false one. \n\nThe disproportionate reaction when something happens to a woman compared to a legalized-system-bias towards men is more dangerous. \n\nWhy the F men would not protest on roads to change family laws and women-pro laws?","i get the sentiment bro, i feel you. although i have a few concerns with this\n\nfirst being, what constitutes as a false rape case, in many cases actual rapists aren't convicted because of lack of evidence, political support, influence due to money/power. would these cases count as false rape cases?\n\nsecond one, if we bring in a specific law for false rape cases, then mayyybeeeee actual rapist who aren't convicted would use the legal system to misuse this provision against the victim.\n\nthe legal system is such a joke not because of the judiciary my brother, but because of us. log hi itne chutiya hai, we need desperately need a social reform instead of more laws."
"I feel for men tho bc, just bcz of a few everyone feels like a suspect. Must have been suffocating.","Thank you for understanding us , it's because of women like you we are protesting against these rapes too cause' we know our innocent sisters and mothers are suffering worst"
False rape cases that are 1 in 1000 between 🤣🤣🤣while 82 women  get raped everyday and so many unreported. ... But yah MEN are always victims in this country (even most of their moms say this so i can't defend anyone here) women too are misogynistic here... Teen raping 3 yr old toddler.. 22 yr old raped by 3...medical doctor getting raped..convicted rapist released due to good behavior rapes a minor..... Rape rape rape every where due to these porn addict freaks.. But yeah lets talk about the very few fake rape cases\n\nFor ur info statswise male criminals > female criminals\n\nAgain it's not all Indian men but always MEN,why u doing men vs women??
"false rape cases may have cases which are just not proven because of lack of evidence, and power.","Yes, this could also happen. A lot of grey area tbh."
Court never ever convicts anyone in a rape case or any criminal case without solid evidences and proper trials. \n\n[Also framing someone in false kidnapping or rape case can lead to severe punishment]( myths regarding judicial procedure is spread either by illiterates who never read law or by degenerates who wanna decriminalize rape.,">Court never ever convicts anyone in a rape case or any criminal case without solid evidences and proper trials.\n\nYou know about shiney ahuja case !?\n\nIt's one of the clearest one out there ?\n\nHe had power and money, hired best lawyers, literally proved that the non-consesual sex was impossible at that time in courts, still convicted, 10 years later the girl confessed \n\nYou want more ?\n\n\n>Also framing someone in false kidnapping or rape case can lead to severe punishment\n\nAlso even though I can't read that post, i still remember that case , there the women willingly accepted lastly that she wasn't raped and she was given punishment which wasn't even severe, it was just that much years of prison the man faced because of being accused by her"

Double standards at its peak. \nAre ab kaha hai humanity?!!!

Muslims in India support Pakistan and other Islamic countries. For them religion is greater than country.,This ideology itself is the biggest problem india has
Both are terrorist regime,"agreed... One genocides, the other is a Jihadist."
"Why is the israel flag on the ground? Hamas is a terror group thats also allies with pakistan. I wouldnt be surprised if the training and warfare tactics were given to these terrorists by them. In the end, islam always supports islam so I understand why muslims for the most part hate israel and support palestine. If Hamas is connected to this recent attack in anyways, things will get worse for them as well.","Isreal is filled with war mongering, blood thirsty jews who are taking their anger out on the wrong group. There is a ceasefire and Israel has continued to ignore it, they have bombed the only cancer hospital in the entirety of gaza strip. They threatened to go to war with newly liberated Syria lol. They bombed Lebanon when it had no hand in the war. They think Jerusalem was ""promised to them thousand years ago""."
Both are problem,Why bhai how can both are problem both are right its a way of showing disgrace to the other countries people but but if a country has a very good relation with other so govt can stop the people for doing this
2 muslims,Both are the same type
"Religiously, Muslims shouldn't step on either of them. First one and second one, both consists of symbols of important personalities for Muslims. Israeli flag consists Star of David important for Muslims as a symbol of their Prophet Dawood and second one is the symbol used by Ottomans. But Muslims aren't that much educated to know what they should do although I ain't anti muslim.",Star of David is a jewish religion symbol and the second is islamic symbol many consider it as so...we don't have any religious symbol but muslims claim crescent moon and star a islamic symbol
You are what we call an instigator.,"Good, we need more people like him."
"No shit. The hate fr israel is justified. They r committing a genocide. Idc whether ur hindu or muslim. Imm not even muslim but israel doesn't deserve any respect. Idk where the second pic is. Is it pak or India. \n\nImm guessing it's rage bait.\n\nWhatever pak has done to India. It doesn't even come near to what israel has done to the islamic community and Palestinians. Being an Indian who obv deplores all terroristic activity by pak. I support the actions taken by the gov also. But I find Israel way more loathsome than Pak, it's not even close.",Really? You know how many times Israel has been attacked and by how many nations? They had given option for the people of gaza ( arabs ) to go into other arab countries. But they refused to take them. Tell me what steps a community of holocaust survivors like Jews should do when they are still being attacked. It has been over a century of attacks on Jews. They had also requested the civilian population of gaza to vacate the cities. They stayed back as a shield of the terrorists who are their brothers.

How did europe lost its culture?,"European countries like the UK, Spain or France had a culture of colonialism, wars or monarchy that they left behind because common people were the ones that were suffering the most so as democracy came in their countries their culture completely modernised in a way now the most important culture in London is football."
But at what cost,just need one mushroom cloud in india thats all
"No matter how developed India gets, it will still be a shit country because of the attitude and ego of the citizens.","It was because of licence raj and super high taxes in 80s, corruption got enrolled in society and morale and mentality began to decline.\nAlso craze for govt jobs started from here cuz of security"
Our culture is one of the reasons we are so behind,Culture gets more relevant as we move away from big cities but in big cities like new delhi or Mumbai its much less relevant. But most of the country is still \nUneducated specially the voting population.
"When you have US helping you rebuild your whole country, sure. In return you'd have an US military base.","Well in Case of Iraq, it never got rebuilt and still got US military base XD"
Main problem about India is politics and religious conflicts,main problem = majority of citizens
"There were no nehru, gandhi, sharad pawar, sharad yadav, lalu yadav, pappu yadav, akhilesh, mulayam, karunanidhi, etc. in Japan to loot and slow their economy and destroy their culture 😒","Tell me how Nehru slowed the economic growth. I think you mean he embraced socialism instead of liberalising.\n\nIf he had just liberalised just like that, our country would be colonised by western mega corporates like how south america is now."

You shouldn't generalize people. I am posting and commenting about this case and following it actively. I am not saying what you said is wrong. But don't generalize and call us names. Feminism means equal opportunity for everyone regardless of gender. So in this case, ATUL SHUBHASH is the victim and justice should be served. And we all stand with him."

"And guess what, all our holy godess temples are on peak of hill /mountains🙏🙏",Its because so much breathing exercises and then finally reaching to relax and enjoy the beauty easily takes you in a meditative state. The ancient were infinetely wise.
"At least they go there due to their devotion,not because uske kisi dost ne insta/snap par trekking ki pic dali aur ab unko bhi social validation k liye pic k liye trekking krna pdega...","fr, mei jabh bhi apne parents ke sath kahin trekking pe gya hun mandir tak ki toh photo toh koi khichta hi nhi hai thodi bht khich lete hai top pe memories ke liye aur mami papa unhe status wagera khin bhi nhi dalte bas memories ke liye khicte hai \n\nvrna log ajkal pta nhi kya dikhna chahte hai ki dekho mei yha agya meri 2000 photos"
"Us Indians also thought ""the temple at the mountain top is more powerful than the temple next to my door""",Which is true. The energy on top of hills are truly more powerful than ones closer down.
"And to be honest, every tracking spot in India has a temple at the top 🥲",There are some which have ancient forts and ruins too. I love those.
"Fun fact : people are asked to break a coconut in the temple that they visit - why??? \n\n\nWell most temples are quite a trek, so our ancestors figured that the best way to keep people energised is to get them to eat a coconut 🥥 copra, which gives good hydration and energy. \n\nTo ensure they do it, they asked you to break a coconut in the temple (and obviously eat it) thus ensuring your healthy and energised.","Ancestors, ya right. out of everything they decided on coconuts which grow in the south. So instead of looking for something which was locally available they chose coconut to energise while trekking at hills  to reach the temple."
"They dont even walk up to the temples, instead exploit horses and asses and people for their ""devotion"".",Lol someone downvoted you for speaking facts!!
"And here the capital subreddit r/delhi deleted all such posts, as mods are mostly pissfuls","That's why I posted here, they're removing every single post"
"I have no idea why Indians from India even support Ukraine, Israel, Palestine, Russia.\n\nOur own country has issues, why not talk about that 1st and when each and every thing is sorted out then we'll see.",majority of the people don't it's mostly right wing edge  lords who does this stuff.
Has any Indian celebrity said anything about this attack. I know they will never condemn it. But at least have they shown sympathy towards those terrorists? Would make it easy to strike them off my movie viewing list.,Almost all of them have said it. You are just blind
"I work in US and have many colleagues from Israel, it was a meeting in early morning for me, and my colleagues knew about the attack before me.\n\nSo as far as Indians' support for Israel, I wouldn't say it is not reciprocated.\n\nIsrael is not just the country that views India most favorably in the world but also the one that sees India least unfavorably in the world. If you ever visit Israel, you'll see the difference.\n\n",What do u want to say?
"Fr like Israelis don't even respect us. They would much rather die than be seen as our ""friend""\n\nWhy are we supporting it then? These guys clearly hate us","That's not true buddy. We have good diplomatic ties with Israel. Supporting Palestine isn't going to do anything good for us. While war is sad everywhere, India as a country cannot be influenced by emotions."
Fr. r/politics & r/noshitsherlock are joking about it,those are American subreddits and they're linking the attack to Vance's visit calling him cursed and shit. I doubt they know the gruesome details of the attack and neither do they want to know.
Bhakts creating their our depression,lundnamazi failed even madarasa english 😂😂
maybe we were raised well.,civic sense describes well
"I wonder why all those people who used to upload stories like ""all eyes on gaza"" are silent now🤷🏻‍♀️","What do you want us to say? I never post about anything, but I would rather post about Gaza than Kashmir. Please read on.\n\nWhy? Because the atrocities in Gaza are (or at least were—I'm not caught up with recent affairs) being committed by a nation state that needs to be put under international pressure.\n\nThe attack in Pahalgam was committed by terrorists. These terrorists were as always supported by Pakistan. The issue is that even though everyone knows this, other nations can't directly accuse Pakistan due to diplomatic reasons. This is the entire reason Pakistan supports terrorists—they damage India while giving Pakistan plausible deniability.\n\nSecondly, if I post a story condemning the attack, what purpose does it achieve? Everybody who sees it would already be equally aware of the attack. I won't affect the opinion of any of my friends, it's not like they support Pakistan. Pressure from India is not pressure. It's more fruitful for me to condemn our own government for the security failure.\n\nPlease stop this Left vs Right war."

It's funny how Western trolls are getting angry in their own way of trolling.,"Most likely, the original tweet was from an Indian. Lots of Indians are out there who are racist towards other Indians."
"There is just so much of hate for Indians on the internet . Funny how this post turned up today on my feed as I was scrolling through threads and a few threads I came across like : which is the most disgusting  food in the world : Indian , dirtiest place on earth : India etc . It was like every other thread had negativity for Indians . One guy even commented “poo coloured skin” .\nAs an Indian who lives in London , I have always found westerners quite accepting and nice . I have never faced any discrimination or hate from anyone . \nBut the internet made me feel otherwise .",It's getting worse and worse on internet but better ignore them anyways.\n\nThey know hating India gets Engagement more than anything.So yeah it's not stopping anytime soon we have to just ignore and move on.

"Peak trolling and funny post, upvoted.","cant understand why people find mom jokes funny, brainrot?"
"I know many people are going to shit on me for my opinion, but some of the hatred for Indians in the western media and people is totally justified. The reason behind why we are hated so much, is nobody else but Indian themselves. Many Foreigner tourists gets scammed in India so badly. Most of the phone call scammers come from India. India is considered top 10 most dangerous and unsafe counties for women. Female foreign tourists gets harrassed, eve teased, and the most shameful, sometimes, Raped in India. We all can't ignore what happened with the Spanish and the Brazilian tourists. If somebody tries to positively criticize us, we shit on them, mindlessly blabbering about our so called Glorious Past. We should actually address the problems and try to solve it, instead of going over the Internet and trying to mindlessly defend ourselves.",Everything you mentioned happens everywhere in the world. Considered top 10 most dangerous and being in top 10 are 2 different things.

Biharis consider themselves as Indian while south Indians consider themselves as 'South Indian',"I read your deleted comment. I feel bad for your classmate. But why are you generalizing some immature kids who did that to that of the entire southern half of your own country? Not everyone's the same. And also please remember that assholes come from all caste, colour, creed and region."

What happened when you guys called us all madrasis?we faced all such discrimination in our childhood visits to north states.\nAll they looked for is at our skin color and we cant speak hindi.,"Saying someone madrasi is like referring to people who belong to that part of India, about discrimination it is everywhere like how people from east are treated and even north people face same situation in south. I used to live in Chennai and have faced many problems, weird looks and language barrier."
"To be honest the more I read about Dravidian politics more disgusted I felt with it. Never seen such blatant hypocrisy of an ideology. The only accomplishment it has that it has kept couple of twats relevant in politics. Besides that there is no good that it has done. Caste problems have not been solved in Tamil Nadu, hatred in people have been instilled and by diverting people with hate they are able to be in power despite their scams and corruption worth crores. This is why Tamil Nadu will get rid of this cancer only if BJP gets hold there. {not a staunch BJP supporter but it is only a practical solution}",Replacing a problem with another problem is not a good solution. Getting rid of caste politics to bring in religious politics. The people don’t want that.
"I'm a South Indian woman (Kerala), and the reason I stated this from the get-go is because I know how blatant the discrimination is.\n\nI've lived in Kolkata, in Delhi, in Mumbai and even in Jammu. And yes, while there is discrimination in both South and North, I have never been made to feel inferior in any of these cities. The light hearted bantar was only aimed at the language or even my dialect. But in South I've seen a politically backed agenda to diss and demean people.\n\nIt is so disheartening to see this. I mean, the country is so rich and diverse that the differences should be celebrated, never divided further.","I can speak for Mumbai. While it’s good that you had a great experience there, do remember that there are places in the city where locals let alone a newcomer to the city face discrimination like being denied housing based on what kind of food they eat. They are like one thirds of the city now. Idk if it’s politically backed or plain superiority complex but it’s sad to see."

"major issues in manipur, punjab, kashmir etc\n\nEveryday we hear about a woman getting assaulted, S.A'd or killed\n\nEven children are not safe\n\nDont turn a  blind eye towards the obvious because it doesn't fit your narrative",So according to you afg Pak Sri Lanka is better than India in women and child safety
Baaki countries mein aisa ek do baar hi hota hoga...par India mein aise chhote chhote har roj hota hai\nSmall milate jao large banate jao,Tell me last 1 month ke aise incident.
Laughs in Manipur and Kashmir,"So, you think Manipur and Kashmir has worse situation compared to the entire country of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh?\nYou think the riots of England and Germany are better in nature?\nHowever, that's what the index is showing. It is showing that despite 100s dying their index is at 20, 30 etc. and despite situation in India is better, our index is at 116.\nWhat makes you think that's a fair index?"

"Brother, I'm glad you're doing well!\n\nUnfortunately, our country is far from perfect.

Our minorities, poor and ""lower caste"" citizens are not in as safe a place as you are.\n\nIt's not productive drive or subscribe to some one-sided narrative -- the world is a complex place and India is a complex country.\n\nWe have a lot of work to do and a long way to go before we can be proud.","Nope , not at all at the level of Sri Lanka & Bangladesh.\n\nUnrest , LMAO, these are skirmishes at max & for Manipur the fight is between armed tribal militias.\n\nGo to IndiaDefence sub reddit for video proof & how both Meiteis & Kukis aren't ready to sit on the table & resolve the issue."

Name one good female standup comedian,Krishna jab wo sadiii pehen ke comedy circus main aata tha
Disrespecting father's name in the name of humour ?? Where the actual f did you find humour ??,Bhai woh toh bol rha h they try to talk about their father to make it funny but humour toh nhi h kahi bhi
Pitraheen Gatividhiya 😔,But samay raina making dark comedy on relatives death is peak humor 😍\n\nAlso you never know if her dad might be actually toxic or something. There are many such cases.
Zaakir khan is the by far the best influencer,"Best ka toh pata nahi but he respects his parents a lot.\n\nUnki baat, ""Baap ki kimat sirph baap ke gujarne ke baad hi paata chalti hain"" was very heart touching ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹"
"I am a father of two and my own father is still alive.\n\nAll I can say is - EVERY BREATH of your life you are thinking how can i give a better life to my children and/or better education and/or better guidance and/or better standard of living. Basically, your purpose becomes your children.\n\nYou need to become a father to understand this. There's no sub here.","You can't generalize this statement. What about fathers who rape their own daughters? Drink and torture their spouse and children? Be irresponsible with money? Abuse them? Always think they are right? \n\nMoreover the ONLY reason you love your children  is because they share your DNA, would you love your kids if they didn't share your DNA? Love towards one's children is selfish and simply a byproduct of Darwinian evolution, there is nothing morally great/ emotional about what you said."
"Believe me guys , these kind of girls are really poison to our society.",Still better and more useful then you ever be as a man
"Not really a feminist but dude 😒 \n\nI'm certain you find madhur virli very funny when he makes jokes on his dead father 😒\n\n\nPS: I don't hate either of them, cause it's comedy they don't mean half of the things they use as a joke.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention the famous one's like bassi when he says his father is drunk or harsh gujral.","Agree, and no one corrects Samay Raina when he makes dark jokes on his own grandparents."
"uska baap daaru pike uski maai ko maarta hai, ab bol",hope she gave the context before making that comment then
bhai male comedian ne bahut banaye hai jokes on his father and mother way more than female comedian unke bhi videos daldeta toh statement tera justified lagta mujhe liken abh toh insta se nikla dank ka choda lag raha hai bhai tu,"Fact 1: The post is about ""disrespecting fathers for humor isn't cool."" I don't know where you saw gender inequality in it. \n \n\nFact 2: There are very few funny female comedians, and there's no shame in admitting it.  \n\n\nFact 3: Only girls are going to upvote your comment."
Osho is speaking facts \n\nFrom the book Gandhi satya ke sambandh me mere prayog \n\n\nAnd also Sarojini Naidu was threatened in parliament after she said Gandhi's poverty is very costly.\n\nHer Saree was pulled by Gandhi supporters.\n\nOsho is funny but True.\n\n\n\nBut Ranveer said watch parents everyday having sex or join them once ......( Although the joke was copied)\n\nWas not funny or even entertaining.\n\n\nThe media just got a point to blame Samay and Ranveer by overlooking other major problems.,"See, osho's video titled ""spiritually incorrect"""
Kya Matlab ab Parliament mai ispe discussion hoga.,Yogi ji khud inko quote karte the

"One of the greatest legend this country has ever produced. If he was born now, he would've been all over social media.",His recordings are already all over social media. I heard some of them and man it feels like he’s talking in 2020s and not in 60s or 70s
Osho is the one needed right now.. People like him are needed everywhere.. Everytime.. But when they appear people with regressive thinking oppose them,"don't he speak just common sense? but yes, at the same time common sense ain't that common too ...."
How is this related to samay raina?,Osho roasted father of the nation. You know how much of a crime it is to disrespect gandhi.
Isn't it common knowledge?,"Nope. Books and media often portrayed gandhi as a poor poor, not the actual rich poor he was."
Osho always makes sense...,Compare how Osho lived his life with Gandhiji and comment again.
Red so I can Ready myself to flee the country,"Ironically enough, going out and earning in dollars/euros and sending remittances might benefit india more than staying in this shit hole and trying to survive."
Politics is all about choosing between bad and worst🥲,Yeah it is like do you want to die by having cancer or a heart problem?
Slow death is basically life.,Nah it's death but more costly.
Slow is better. Others option is to create new party,Fast death - Chud gye guru
We know our country is fcked when at the end of the day we are all gonna be dead. Red pill still,Yeah the people in America live forever
There are lots of people who don't support either of them... what I'm asking is can't we just form another party?? I'm from kerala here we have 3 of it to choose from but all of them are...bad! I mean there are some good leaders but the party altogether isn't doing anything good.,Instant death>>>>>communist govt \nFuck stalin
"Hindutwaadi Sankaris are really good at Numbers and Comparisons. \n\nSo, 50yrs is not slow, its Fast. And not dying and growing economical and remaining regional power, is death.\n\nFast death = \~50+yrs rule Congress  + yet not dead   \n\nSlow death = \~18+yrs rule BJP/RSS  + yet not dead","Very smart literate liberals are very good at understanding trends, taking in other factors, and re-reading whatever the fuck they write.\n\n\nImagine expressing ""dead/not dead"" as a binary value."
why congress as fast death?(asking genuinely)  \ndidnt most of Indian growth come from their period,It naturally would if they rule for so ridiculously long\n\nIt's over a large time span
"Congress is more mature than BJP in all aspects!\n\nThey need a good PR team to showcase their achievements from IIT IIMS AIMS WAR ATOMIC RESEARCH GLOBALIZATION GREEN REVOLUTION WHITE REVOLUTION INDUSTRIALIZATION NURTURING IT  DAMS MILITARY EXPANSION -\nGREAT EDUCATIONIST GOT TOP POSITIONS\nWAS NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICISING AUTONOMOUS GOVT ENTITIES LIKE COURTS, RBI, ECI, ED, CBI, IT LIKE THE WAY BJP DOES!\n\nTHEY ARE DEFAMED BY GODI, PRESS, SOCIAL MEDIA IT TEAMS TO CREATE AN ILLUSION OF FAILED PARTY- BILLIONS OF RUPEES ARE BEING SPENT FOR THIS!\n\nWE WILL REGRET IF WE EVEN LOSE THEM AS OPPOSITION!","For the Congress to rise again, Rahul and Priyanka must not just quit politics, but also leave the country.\n\nQuit India 2.0."
Politics is always about choosing the better among the worst,It's truly a game of business party board game.

Lol I stopped receiving gifts from my mom dad and relatives, outsiders after 11 year age 💀\nAnd The last gift I got was a notebook and a barbie watch (I'm a boy BTW never wore it just kept it in the drawer) \n\nNever bothered anyway cuzz it feels free when you are not binded with the chains of hope others uses to bind you that's called birthday gift. \n\n(yeah mujhe angur Ni Mila ab angur Ko khatta bolunga lol 😂 my wish)","ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT A GUY CAN'T HAVE A BARBIE WATCH?😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬\n\n\n\njk lol, but try to at least gift yourself smth for your birthday. Celebrate it."
"I honestly felt like crying one day( couldnt even do that cuz i haven't cried in like 5 years) when people I considered close friends forgot my birthday while seemingly wishing everyone else at 12 sharp. Never held a birthday as an important day but maybe it's fomo or maybe it's a feeling of being invisible,  it was awfully melancholic.",The same brotha hasn't cried since 2017 nobody even knows my birthday except my family members nobody wishes except them birthday..... specially this year I will be fucked my bd is on 15th dec and the cutoff list for competitive exam I'll give will come on 14th dec
"Lemme correct that \n\nthere is no such thing as a birthday for men and boys after ""14"" 💔",Y'all dont have siblings or parents to celebrate your bday with? Especially if you're 14

"Classic Zionist media campaign that started from 9/11 where you demonise Muslims/Arabs in any movie, show, cartoon etc to the point where America can bomb a million of them and no one woud even bat an eye. \n\nNo matter what happens, subconsciously, muslims/Arabs will always be the bad guys in any conflict regardless of the context.",Why is it that most terrorists are muslim?
"They did the stereotypes for each race (Black, Asian etc.) and religion(Christian and Muslim) . But they did not do a Hindu Character yet, let's see in the coming season if they do. What stereotype would that be though?",I don't think that there is a Hindu character in the comics the closest they got was Doctor Sameer in season 4 whose leg got chopped off and the season 5 would be the last season which will list likely focus on Butcher and homelander. So I would say we won't get any Hindu or Indian character in the main series but maybe in the side series like Gen V and Vought origins

3 lakh active mosques all over the country yet they have to block the road for their 'prayer',"A few are going to be demolished na, so there's a bit of shortage,"
Now problem of this country is that police officer is now suspended,This is what is wrong with our nation. Appeasement Appeasement Appeasement.

Update: The Police Post Incharge seen kicking the Namazi in the video has been suspended with immediate effect.  Disciplinary action will be taken.  \n- North Delhi DCP Manoj Kumar Meena,Ye namaz darga me padhi jati hai na?
"For my Hindu,Muslim,Christian,sikh brothers who are commenting that kicking them was wrong;-  \n1) Blocking road for your prayers is never justified  \n2) If u think that 1 single police officer could have dragged 10-20 strong men, HOW? LIKE HOW?, He would have dragged one of them,later when he goes for another the 1st one sits again, so think practically  \n3) He had to take quick action becoz clearing traffic was the main task, he had to react quickly, becoz we dont know if someone was suffering in that traffic. He had pressure and he had to take the appropriate action  \n4) ""HE SHOULD HAVE TALKED"" My guy do u really think u can convince insane people who decided to pray at the road in the first place?",This comment should get more votes than idiots hating muslims .
"Yar donon ki galti hai.\n\nKahin bhi aise namaz nahi padh sakte tum pehle to\n\nAur dusra, agar koi padh bhi Raha hai to use thodi tameez se bhi bola ja sakta hai.","Agree with the former, not the latter.\n\nThose guys knew exactly what they were doing. Blocking the middle of the road, without permission, is not the norm. Go and do this on the footpath or somewhere else.\n\nThis isn’t some side street/gali; this is a busy road with buses plying on it and a flyover right there.\n\nYou are literally making buses and other vehicles wait so that you can finish your prayers. Who knows how long they are offering their prayers for? How can anyone think that it is ok for them to block so many vehicles? \n\nThey were doing it because in their minds: praise my God and f everyone else!\n\nThere’s a saying in Hindi, which is exactly apt here: laaton ke bhoot baton se nahi maante.\n\nAlso, legally speaking, they are wrong and offenders. It’s the job of the police to enforce law and maintain order. The policeman in the video is doing exactly that.\n\nTo add: this is different if you have gotten permission for an urus, jalsa, or procession or are at least moving."

Ye to meri bat krri hai,Didi bol tho such rhi hai. But nice guys are major ditched and fucked by girls in relationship that they give up on it. Or how many girls actually reply to nice guys or take them seriously.

"And the one who takes the risk and tries, and gets a girl, the girl (the type of girl which the girl in the video is talking about) betrays the guy in some way or another. Then he actually gives up, like in real, and maybe loses all hopes in love, and that is it. He might be done for life.","Not so easy. Wait till she accuses him under article 498a and have his parents go to jail, his reputation ruined, take away half his lifetimes savings (remaining half will be spent on lawyers fees) and leave him bankrupt; while she enjoys this free money with her new BF. 😏\n\nThen he might be done for life."
"Lol women waiting for green flags after getting ruined by multiple red forests. Better stay away from any Indian women. Even if she is married to you, the day her toxic ex calls her back, she will run back. Modern Indian women are the lowest of the low.","Don't forget the consequences life ruined, parents in jail, reputation fucked, half money in alimony/child support, other half spent on lawyer, Life's a constant mess, you end up lifetime prison. All this while she enjoys with her BF\n\nMay god do justice In afterlife"

So for men like us..we need women who approach us and make us realise that we can be worthwhile for them and not useless..we need confidence from u ladies....I am one of those guys who myself backed out thinking I don't deserve such an awesome lady and didn't make the move to a committed relationship when she was being friendly....it's like self inflicted wound that we do on us ..and feel further depressed when we see guys whom we feel are much worse than us as person end up getting women and worse ..take those women for granted,This is too much for me to read.

Gandu the Ripper,Gandu the gandvi killer.
Basic class 10th sst padhi hoti to pata hota Gandhi India mai 1915-16 mai aaya tha,Basic class 10 ko ye bhi pta hota hai ki he was in south Africa for two decades before coming back to India for good.
He arrived on 29th september in London whereas jack the ripper's first victim documented was on 3rd april.\n\nUnless jack the ripper was 2 different person they can't be same,"meme hai, meme ke jaise lo"
"They are fairly sure who Jack the Ripper was, a man admitted to Broadmoor matched the description of him and the murders stopped when he was admitted.\n\nDo your research Jerry.","Jack the Ripper was never caught by the police. The identity of the killer or killers remains unknown, and no one was ever arrested or prosecuted for the murders attributed to Jack the Ripper, which took place in the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. Despite numerous suspects and extensive investigations, both at the time and in the years since, the case remains one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in the annals of crime.\n\nYou should also stop saying these conspiracy theories."

Mere dost ne bhi aise without context meme dala tha Chakke uthake leke chale gaye aur HIV de diya,So in 2012 or maybe benzema fucked a 15year old girl but he didn't knew this because she lied about her age
A 15 years old girl lied about her age and banzema (french footballer) slept with her then revealed her real age,Not really I think it something in 2009 I think? Where he and Ribery paid a girl for sex and when he was sent to Trial they couldn't make sure if she was actually under 18 and it's not allowed to fuck anyone under 18 by paying them. If it's with Consent without paying anyone then it's fine with age of Consent being 15 but I might be talking about something else. Btw Back then Kareem Benezema was 21.
KYA MTLB MAI RAJASTHANI HI HU 💀,Is joke m ab mja nhi ata ....

"The hate you guys give him just for reservation is ridiculous!!! He himself never wanted reservation to be this long...You don't how much he means to us.. It is the politics of India which still keeps reservation also if you are against reservation be against the system not the people who possess it. I am a reserved candidate it is so hard to tell someone about this in real life , they judge you alot and sometimes even receive taunts. Behaving wrong against us wont remove reservation. \n+ Removing reservation won't remove casteism\n\n++ I am not against any religion , I beleive majority of people beleive in the religion they were born in..

Bhai aur koi kaam nahi hai kya other than this language shit. Imagine going to China and asking all the Indians living there to force the Chinese to speak Hindi. Is it fair in any way ? If I am coming to settle in Delhi or UP I would surely learn Hindi(at least the basics). Why don't you guys understand simple logic.,most people pick up basic stuff like yes no and some other when they go to other places but asking them to learn whole sentences when they could get by without them is useless and it's not like it's worth it anyway i remember sometime back when that news of allu arjun fans beating prabhas fans came up and the people in banglore sub saw those guys as some outsider even though they could speak kannada what for would someone learn the language if he will still be a outsider . Someone can call your out for your hindi in delhi but no one can say that you don't belong there that's the difference

And she don't spend a penny of hers but when you talk with her she is like I am doing all this ,I look after my whole family,  I am a strong independent woman ,I don't need men and always talk bad things about men . I always feel pity for her .

The only problem is people who showoff they get praise but people who do hardwork they are not getting enough recognition",Her bf is a simp

Gandhi and shashtri ji both had their fair share of achievements and done a lot for india in their own timeline as per their ability.\none guy helped making India exist as sovereign independent State and other one helped it running better by implementing projects like green revolution etc.\nAlthough Gandhi can be critisized for his many decisions and actions but still his actions in making India independent and raising awareness throughout the country to fight and repel britishers can't be denied and ignored.\nThese comparisons are of no meaning and doesn't mean anything other than indicating your sheir hatred of gandhi.,Relax bro. Teenage edgelords from Incelmemer love to hate on Gandhi because appreciating his contribution to India's freedom struggle is too mainstream.

How does she keep getting elected back to CM??,"Stayed in Bengal for 6 years. I will try to answer with my limited knowledge -:\n\n1. Killing or threatening opposite party members so that they won't contest election. This normally happens in panchayat and municipality elections. Last panchayat elections - TMC party won 36% of seats unopposed, meaning there was no opponents.\n\n2. Booth capturing. TMC goons aka social clubs are present in every few kms. They are funded by TMC. During elections, they capture booth and make sure you vite for her only. Police too side with TMC.\n\n3. Many government employees were kept away from voting as didi know that they won't vote for her.\n\n4. Muslims vote for her in a unit as muslims know once bjp enters they won't be able to do as they please.\n\n5. There is a history of killing opposition party members in bengal. CPM did that to congress and TMC, TMC gave it back to CPM tenfold. So it gets really difficult to a party to get hold once it's out of power. CPM party is almost gone and in many places their supporters didn't returned home for last 15 years in fear of getting killed.\n\n6. A good percentage of women vote for mamata thanks to lot of subsidy she allocate for women. Examples - laksmi bhandar, kanyashre, rupashree, etc. Its seems the women here are still not empowered enough in this feminine state.\n\n7. Communism flows in most of bengali's blood. They think it's cool to oppose the party at center. So, just for that many vote for mamata.\n\n8. Many families vote for mamata whose children get into jobs through bribes. Many students who have cleared the exam and waiting for interview or job letter vote for her as they are scared that once party changes, new government might cancel all previous recruitment.\n\n\nThere are many more things I have heard from my father's bengali colleagues, I don't know if it is true. For example - Many say voter card have been given to many bangladeshis, who enters India during elections. Give vote and then go away.  Other rumour is that TMC made fake voter card for bangladeshi immigrants so that they can vote for them. Right now, I can think of these. There are more though, I just have to ask some bengali."

"How many of you who speak to criticize religion and fight over God's actually looked into the Devil? And how the devil occupies your thoughts, how the devil shows you a wrong path to look righteous? How killing each other is not mentioned in any religious book except for defending and fighting for the right cause, if Islam is not Peaceful neither is Hinduism where Ramayan and Mahabharat is about WAR, while in christianity jesus telling his followers to pick up the sword. All you fools are slaves of the Devil and no wonder you all fight each other instead of your own self to be freed from the devils I fluence.","Islam isn’t peaceful as it’s clearly mentioned  in your holy texts that idolators should be killed and there’s only one true God . And as far as Hinduism is concerned it’s a very peaceful religion which has always been accommodating of others , Mahabharata and Ramayana don’t propagate unnecessary war and don’t teach us to pick up arms randomly . In Ramayana Ram has to eventually resort to war to save his wife who has been abducted , it teaches us how to respect women and fight for our people  (and don’t pretend that you or anyone else who’s kin and near and dear ones have been abducted or hurt won’t resort to this after trying everything to save them ) . And in Mahabharata when Arjun becomes unsure and doesn’t want to fight , lord Krishna tells him that he tried to be peaceful yet he couldn’t prevent a war because Kauravas actively want a war , and since someone is at your doorstep ready to fight you and even unalive you , then obviously you should take up arms . That’s what the Mahabharata and Ramayana are about , either learn what you are taking about or don’t you our texts in your comments ."

And yes he really cooked . Period ."

Here is where he is wrong.\n\nIf he really swears on the constititution he should respect the other faiths regardless of the people of other faiths respecting his religion. That is exactly he does not want to do.,"Nope kiddo  ,as humans we might have a basic respect for everone but whether we continue to respect them or not depends on how they treat us . Respect is a two way thing and so is peaceful coexistence. Secularism also exits for everyone to follow  it , so only one person or religion isn’t obligated to bear the brunt alone ."

So he's saying he's got no personality of his own so he's copying others but the other way around?,Haan just like how you proved you don’t understand English and the working of secularism and respect .
Hence proved Yogi ji is no more worth than a Muslim,You can't fight extremism with liberalism
"So there is one muslim who respects other religion and one muslim who does not. So where do you stand? Depending on which muslim you are talking to? Is it min, max, average of respect from all muslim? If you principles vary depending on whom you talk you, are they even principles?",Then the first muslim doesn't understand Islam. Quran clearly states that Islam is above every religion. Not to mention that Islam doesn't respect atheists/polytheists. Even muslims cannot marry non muslims.
I respect yogi as much as I respect asaram,I respect asaram more than I repect Muhammad.
"what a joke lmao. even if 100% of muslims start hating on hinduism, it doesnt give him a card to disrespect secularism. he is a goddamn CM and should act like one. India is gonna remain a shit hole because of this religion issue. Show respect, not reciprocity. (downvote me all you want, doesnt change the fact)",He didn't curb the religious freedom of Muslims. He just states that respect goes both ways and that Muslims can't disrespect other religions and oppress their followers without consequences.
so that makes him just as awful as muslims,so are we supposed to tolerate every bs they do and say? or we should surrender ourselves to them?
So he is going to learn from the Muslims ? Is he claiming he doesn't have his own sense of morality for what he should do and will learn from what Muslims teach him to do ?,Maybe he wants to say that that's how he will deal with muslims
"""I am a terrorist as much as the Islamists.""\n\nThere.. I completed his thoughts.",Lol. All muslims are terrorists now?
"Yogiji forgot he is not mahant of some Peeth but Cheif minister of the biggest state, so whatever his personal belief are it shouldn't reflect on his duties as CM of the state. This is Mahant Yogi, what is the role of CM Yogiji?","I agree, but what do you think is wrong in this statement?"
"You know what is the essence of Hinduism/sanatan/vedic, whatever you call, is respecting every belief, it will happily accept every every faith/religion. And gives same respect to every other religion or belief as he gives his own. It's not uncommon to see a hindu bowing with same respect in front of Gurudwara, Mosque or church or any other religious institution.\n\nIf we also behave the same way which others do,  Then we are basically loosing pure essence of Hinduism, for which Hinduism is respected all over the world. And in other sense we are becoming same like them. Then what will be difference between them and us.",But we have no choice. Islam is clearly against Hinduism. So why should we respect Islam?
It's means teaching of hinduism and islam is same.,we aren’t taught to tolerate.. if someone disrespects us we must give them taste of their own medicine

Op comparing dogs 🐕 with North Indian people 🥲,OP is comparing dogs with Kannadogs because they both bark at you when you're minding your own business
Dogs are not northies (even though they act like that).. that's just a terrible comparison,"Not everyone from Karnataka or Bangalore, speak in Kannada. So good enough comparison."
"And street dogs are arguing to the auto driver like, ""par hindi to rashtra bhasha hai na"" 💀",Dogs bark atleast don't impose kannadigaa on poor dogs have some shame 🤣🤣🤣
Idk about all the racism from you pieces of crap. I am glad that now you use “Kannada” over “Kannad”,Thanx for letting me know 😈
Plz UP and Bihari stay in your home don’t come to our state,Naarthies are bad Saar we good Saar they bad Saar wat tu du saar ayiyiyooo

Please don't call all Hindi speaking people are street dogs.,We are calling kannadniggas retards as they won't even spare dogs for their kannada speaking fetish
Ahhh....Autodrivers always fight with dogs. Especially dogs which are migratory.,Yes those who  migrated from Africa

I love how calm she was after getting the shit slapped out of her,"Meanwhile if this was India, simps would be gathered applying balm on her 🤡"
Looks like he was waiting for the moment... Newton's law.,"That ""bam"" was so satisfying, it sends a strong message to pseudo-feminist cults"
"""How can she slap!""\n\nIf this was India, she'd slap him and then everyone else would slap him too.",India is full of simps always begging for her attention. They should be taught feminism in same way like this hoe

You turn me off like a light switch,And cook me up like instant noodles 🤣
She ate that slap pretty well,-100 aura for beating a man\n+5 aura for not crying for attention \n\n😂
I wonder why did she try that in the first place!?,Maybe she thought the guy was not a supporter of Gender equality and won't do anything physical.
"Basically fuck around and find out.\nAlso, it felt like she got her entire system rebooted which made her question her entire life's decisions.",True. She'll now prefer to be back to kitchen after trying to misuse her pussy-pass\n\n![gif](giphy|v5F26WyYwzOYnsfX1b|downsized)

Yeah definitely. They went from samurais to\n\n![gif](giphy|11lxCeKo6cHkJy),No way you think everyone in their society was a samurai??? Mf the fact that you know what a samurai is proof that they have preserved it well enough. No more than 1% of Japanese would know anything about our ancestors other than the fact that we got destroyed by British.
"Yeah I mean preserving the culture does NOT mean you can't follow/practice other religions.\n\nBasic idea of religion is to have faith in someone which helps a person to keep working and moving in life and doing good deeds. \n\nCulture is something people develop and future generations practice. And in that case, tbh, Europe is better than us, infact better than most of the countries (except middle East and a few south asian).","Changing religion affects the cultural practices too\n\n\nYou see Drinking Alcohol was allowed in Persia.

"This is nothing new. The cycle of war will repeat itself as it has for thousands of years. Back then it was sticks and stones. Now the sticks and stones have gotten much bigger, faster, and they are airborne. \n\nOld men in suits will dictate orders. Young men will follow them and die. Innocents on both sides will die. One side will have more casualties. Families on both sides who lost loved ones will fill their heart with hate and will want retaliation. So they'll vote for more radical leaders. Who will shout slogans for more wars. \n\nEventually commonsense will prevail for some time and the war will stop. And then suddenly someone will repeat the cycle by attacking the other side again. \n\nHonestly it's getting boring at this point. There is nothing new to see here. It'll make headlines for a few days. We will all watch it for a few minutes.

"Coz its reverse. Israel bombs and kills thousands and ensures nothing grows there for the next 10 yrs..world moves on. \n\nSomeone else bombs Israel as a retaliation, then they have the exact footage and the exact count of number of bombs dropped and the cries of 'oh innocent civilians' have now to sleep in bomb shelters. \n\nIt is a colonist state with terrroist methods. India does not need to have people simping for Israel's actions . There is something called as collective karma, ask yourself if you would want a share of Israel's karma which is filled with looting, lying, and genocide.","Sure, Iran bombed Israel in retaliation we all have functional brain and can distinguish who is retaliating and who is instigating. so, many people are happy that Iran bombed Israel and are boasting about it, this same people will post ""All eyes on Iran"" when Israel will retaliate. \n\nStop simping for Iran and Hezbollah, you are not with the good guys and stop pretending they are not getting what they deserve. \n\nYou guys started it during independence of Israel and Palestine by 6 countries collectively attacking Israel and still got beat and after that did not honour any peace treaty. \n\nIndians don't simp for Israel, but are just tired of all the victimhood of the Islamist and observing the same pattern with the whole ummah state vs Israel in the middle east, we can relate. stop instigating if you can't handle retaliation."
You Modi chumps are hilarious. No honor or dignity.,Are u hurt lil bro ?
"I don’t fully understand the Iran-Israel conflict, but I believe Iran’s leadership should reconsider their approach. Attacking Israel, backed by powerful countries like the U.S. and Europe, seems reckless. Even if Israel provoked Iran, there are better diplomatic solutions.\n\nAs for the UAE and Saudi Arabia, they often position themselves against Iran, but in reality, they rely on Iran for essential imports like vegetables. If that supply stops, prices will rise sharply. These countries need to find a way to maintain a balanced relationship with Iran for the sake of economic stability.",U need to fact check ur vegetables story .. uae get  its grocery from india rather than iran

"God doesn't forgive one's sins if he only surrenders himself to god, he does so only if one truly asks for forgiveness for his sins (one explanations for this might be so that one might know the graveness of ones sins though other explanations are also available) I suppose the men writing the bible and the men writing those hindu scriptures had different interpretations about what life after death might be. One believes in rebirth and one believes in an eternal afterlife. So imo it might be unwise to judge others faith. One thing is for sure though both philosophies seek for the betterment of humanity and the whole world sure some problems lies in each one of them but that cannot overshadow the true greatness which lies between each. In the end I firmly believe that both the philosophies demand respect",What is original sin? Is it a sin that people had done intentionally or given by some sky man.

What am i supposed to do with this realisation ?\nGive me a solution,"This may be bad advice...but hey...its free.\n\nSpend your time as a single person by being the best single person you can be.  Be kind, educate yourself, invest in your life physically, mentally and spiritually because it will be so much harder to do that when you are in a relationship. Figure out who you want to be and what you want from life. \n\nRight now, your focus is on the other person.  Most likely, it is because you are hoping to increase your self worth/self esteem, but those come from yourself.  Looking at what you don't have means you aren't focusing on what you are.  When watching the video, I take it that guys are very obvious about what they want...not WHO they want.\n\nFigure out what qualities are necessary for your partner and be sure to base them on who YOU are.  That is why its important to be the best person you can be...so you can offer that to someone who has the qualities you want.  A person who is quick to anger doesn't deserve a kind person.  A person who is a slob doesn't deserve a person who is careful with money.  People in relationship with their opposite are co-dependent and usually unhappy.  Hopefully you are looking for love.  Relationships based on love enhance each other, not fill gaps.\n\nWhat is awesome about you, is that you aren't just saying...hahaha!  She's got us down!  You are wanting to take the next step...and that is admirable.  Good luck!"

Once happened with me. I was eating chaat at a cart and suddenly few people came and started beating the seller. Probably one of them had some issue with him. It was not very serious but they hit him 8-10 slaps and he fell on ground then they left. In meanwhile all the customers ran away due to fear but shameless me was sitting all the time and eating there as i didn't wanted my 25rs to get wasted🫡,every part of this keeps on getting funnier. You even counted the slaps while sipping chai?

Not to ruin the joke but there is water on the moon.,It is not potable. I think he is referring to potable water.
Casual question\n\nDo people there speak hindi commonly? I assumed urdu is primarily spoken there or probably a mix of hindi & urdu.,"Urdu and Hindi are essentially dialects of the same language with slightly different vocabulary and different scripts, hence they are mutually intelligible in more informal speech as in this video.

"In the trains,The toilet pipe is open i.e if u pee in the train,it will directly go on the tracks.So the bridges have gap between them hence it is a hygiene case for the commuters",If you are in a hurry in these cases you may end up with 💩 all over you
Dadar ke pull ke neeche-,Teri ma bhajiya tale...
Ppl still think that toilet pipes are open in trains that is why they are waiting for the train to pass. Which is not the case nowadays as railways already use bio toilets in all trains. Even for general coaches.,No bro last week I was seeing the track and my shit at the same time 🤣🤣.\nNot every coach. I don't trust these indian railway 🤡
"People giving the reason of open toilets, that's wrong things have changed they aren't open anymore  \nREAL REASON--   \nAs you can see the bridge is rusty and prone to accident , so they stop to prevent 'THE TRAIN' falling on them",Nah bro.. I still see open one
I think they don't trust the structure of the bridge😐,"7600/750= 10mm permissible deflection for the girder. So yea, that's a cause for concern"
Now a days every train is upgraded to bio-toilet. I think ppl are stopped might be that bridge is weaker. Pillar might be weaker,That should basically be the cause. I mean there is still a chance of the train falling over. But I guess staying direct below from it's fall is much worse an accident than getting to escape if you are not directly under. But this is not what we should be discussing about but rather : Is the railway committee aware of old and rust bridges that spawn around in localities which are to repaired?\nIf not how can we get thier attention to fix it.
It's either bihar or these people are biharis.,"No this is Delhi. Old iron bridge. And this particular spot is notorious for showering people with feces and urine. Most are just cautious even if it's a goods carrying train. There is a saying right, ""doodh ka jala..."" 🤣"
Folklore says you die if you pass beneath a bridge having a running train.,Lmao I should be a 👻 by now after passing under railway subways thousands of times with local trains thundering above.
Elephants helping Men exercise.,He's a real bro for that
I never saw any women whipping them. Just saying.,"I've seen an elephant crush a woman's skull...\n\nThe reason, why the elephant is chasing them has two probable reasons.\n\nHe has been in contact with poachers and now remembers humans= danger.\n\nMost likely it's a male elephant... During the season.\n\nThat could also be a mother/grand mother / aunt elephant when the calf is still young.\n\nAs for the first vid of gentle elephant. That one probably grew up around humans and is comfortable with them or maybe even knows the woman.\n\nElephants are wonderful creatures who can remember people. Those who've grown in care  of humans will usually single out the guy they don't like.\n\nAh also, it could be a drink elephant being aggressive. they can get easily drunk cuz they have very low tolerance for alcohol..."

I think bro confused his BP test.,"High IQ nahi, high BP thha fir toh. Now the angry uprooting of handpump makes sense."
Bro is suffering from intelligence,Blud is over educated
Bhai ye Banda kaafi dumb baat kar rha hai agar itna IQ high hota toh sahi script toh choose karta movies ke liye,He chose a high IQ script. Low iq people won't understand it.

"That's ok because there are predators online. If I were a parent, I'd rather spy silently and say nothing until I know that the other person is up to something wrong.",Exactly. It is their age to do such things. Parents just need to give some security over it.

I also believe that her daughter is very aware of the fact that her mom is spying. I mean modern day android systems at least will make the user known if someone is capturing the screen,i think that can come off as a notification or so that your screen is being shared or viewed\n\nbut notifications can be easily disabled\n\n\nstill a bitchy thing for a mom to do

Diversity of india love it👌,"Nah, more like insecurity of people\n\nThe downvotes are only proving me right, I guess people are insecure here too."
Everyone is practicing their own religion... Good👍,"I feel like if the religions were reversed, it might have offended some people."
I wonder who they are trying to provoke here 🤔,ikr I can't even see that guy. IMAGINATION
Lodu ko yaad tak toh hai nhi,"aaj kal ke teens ya jo bhi keh lo adults sanatan hone ka dhong kar rhe hai, inke paas koi way of life hai nahi to isse hi goal maan ke chal rahe hai, real sanatan is more than just forcing hinduism."
Ek muslim side main pray kar rha hai tabhi unko ye krne ki yaad aayi. Warna inme se koi na kare aisa.,Pure hafte hi na kare lekin ab karna hai
Reverse the situation ( 5 m vs 1H ) and then we see the true picture,He would have got beaten or killed
Hindus ko muslims ko pray krte dekhkr hi apne bhagwaan ki yaad kyu aati h ?,Just like how mumslims built their mosques just opposite to ram mandir in every part of india
"The guys singing are mostly doing it to irritate the Muslim,also they are disturbing the other passengers in the closed confined with their chants.like pray without troubling others","same with loudspeakers from mosques, while surrounding population isn't even muslim"
Sab pagal hai but group zyada annoying because\n\n1. They're doing it to assert dominance over the Muslim dude and recording it as well.\n\n2. They're being loud af intentionally. Being loud af is so uncivil.,"this, I dont get why Hindus have gotten so insecure that everytime they see a Muslim person praying they have to start yelling and shouting, trying to show what a “Hindu Sher” they are🐯"
Unemployment noises,"i have seen micro aggression like these IRL as well, bas kehne keliye desh secular bacha hain \n\nmost of these mfs have no idea about spirituality yet they will try to use it to assert dominance\n\nand its pointless to argue with people who truly believe there is nothing wrong with this video"

They mock everyone.. \nI support all nepali people from the bottom of my heart.

Comment section filled with simps lmaoo. Literally 2 months ago there was a clip of a fat American on this sub only making a joke on cancer too. The people there in the comment section were saying bad things about him but because this is a girl they ain't lmao. Get a life,"So anyone whose opinions doesn't align with urs is a simp? And ""Getting a life"" coming from a Jee aspirant is the most ironic shit lmao. Grow tf up kiddo"
This was actually good💀,"Haha yup I laughed but after a second I felt ""wowh I'm sickkkk !"""
I don't find this dark,South India chale ja bhai
No the saddest thing is pretending like that joke and force laughter.,that might actually have been offensive ...
That’s just disgusting. About her humor. Making it into a living making jokes about people with a serious illness. People usually who mocks others get always a taste of their own. Sometimes your birth a child with cancer you know. You can’t prevent shit like that from happening. Who would be laughing then? Hmm.,You must be fun at open mic night
"My kinda humor..\n\nEven ppl with cancer would laugh at that, Infact they actually need laugh more than sympathetic behavior constantly reminding them of their disease.",I don't think a cancer patient would laugh at his death lol
I didnt understand 🥲,Don't worry even i didn't get it.\nI think this is only relatable to people who have gf or cancer.

India mei cricket bahut pehle se hai bhai.. it has become a part of the culture.. ye 'support football and other sports too' .. 'cricket gets all the attention' .. I hate such arguments. Cricket hai bhai logo ko pasand India mei.. football nhi dekhna chah rhe log... Kya kare ab? Jabardasti thoos de unhe football ke liye pyaar ?,Thoosne ki baat nahi hai bhai. Par baaki saare sports k Khiladi bhi hamare desh k liye hi khel Rahi hai. Sirf cricket mai hamare desh ka naam hona chahiye kya ?. Yeh nahi bol Raha hu ki jinko cricket pasand hai woh jabardasti football dekho par support toh kar sakte ho Naa apne khiladiyon ko. Pasand toh ek bhi sport nahi hoga Olympics ya commonwealth mai par phir bhi support toh karte ho Naa.

there is a veryy thick line between 'baap kon hai' and 'jai shree ram'. using god's name as a way to belittle someone is disgusting and very immoral and rather sinful.,If using gods name is belittling someone then Pakistani players always belittle other religions by invoking their religion unnecessarily. You agree with that?

"Google se search nhi krna ab se , got it 👍",Start using TOR and duckduckgo.
Stay safe giys\n1. Use tor for any queries. Don't use tor with VPN. \n2. Always dispose of the body. Disassembling the body should be the first priority.\n\nStay safe. The world is a cruel place.,Why not just eat it ?
"1. ⁠If you need to hide a body, bury it 6-10 feet beneath the body of a dead animal. When the police dogs find it and it is dug up, they will find the body of the animal and move on, thinking it was a false positive.\r  \n\r\n2. ⁠If you are burying a full body, bury it vertically. Satellites orbiting earth look for suspicious holes approx. 6 feet long.\r  \n⁠\n3. Drain the body of fluids in a tub, using bleach to mix with them to help with the smells. Take precautions to keep your house from smelling like death, even from sinks or other drains. Draining the body will keep decomposition at bay and makes it easier to portion the body into smaller bits, which makes burial easier. It takes less time, and you will also not need to explain to your neighbors why you are “tending to your tomatoes” at 3am.\r  \n\r\n4. ⁠If a dog or other small animal happens across a smaller piece, it will more likely eat it, which would prove more difficult if it was the whole body.\r  \n\r\n5. ⁠If you can’t bury it, hide it in a septic tank. They hold a plethora of bacteria, and the smell of waste covers the stink of decomposition very well.\r  \n\r\n6. ⁠Destroy all teeth, massacre the face, and burn all fingertips/remove fingers to prevent identification except from DNA.\r  \n\r\n7. ⁠At the crime scene, wipe down all surfaces, and take your victims hands and run them along things. Pick up cups, touch tabletops or counters. A room with zero fingerprints is very suspicious.\r  \n\r\n8. ⁠If you live near the ocean, you can drain the body and cut it up, mixing it with fish parts, and use it to chum the water. Stick around and fish for awhile so no one will get suspicious. That way you don’t have a body at all to raise suspicion. Plus, you might catch a marlin or something.\r  \n\r\n9. ⁠Finally, remember that the chances of you getting caught are significantly reduced if you murder someone who has no connection with you. Most murderers end up killing someone that has some relation or connection with them, and are caught easily. Serial killers kill at random, hence why it is so much harder to catch them.\r  \n\r  \nI’m not a serial killer, I promise. Just stuff I found on the internet. Stay safe people",Saving it for later.\nJust for general knowledge.

context?,"The driver, Bharat Soni, was arrested in connection with the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The police went through 700 CCTV footages to arrest the accused. The accused's house was demolished because it was built on government land."
"One time I went for documents verification where you need to go to the police station , so I think their was a case  jaha ek banda uske Bandi ko bhaga ke laya Tha,  and woh dono pkde gae....then \n\nthe father of the boy was begging to the mother of the girl...to forgive  him , that he had failed as a father...\nhe was saying that "" didi , mai sirf maafi Mang skta hu..."" , haath jodke woh bhi....I was feeling bad for that man...and the lady was also treating him well , that bhaiya aisa Mt kahiye , paani pilijiye , etc , but she was very disappointed also....but that man's condition was very heartbreaking...\n\nI will never do something Jesse mere parents ko kissi se maafi mangni pade....",That's heartbreaking. Such cases really do make me stressed. I hope no one has to suffer like that.
Bhai yeh video dekh ke legit bura laga tha . Dil tut gya yaar,"uske pita ji ko dekh kr mereko bhot dukh hua, bhale hi mereko ghar waale kuch bhi bole pr mai apni wajah se unko dukh nahi se sakta bc. I literally cried yesterday after seeing this interview."
What's the point of demolishing their house? \nIt wasn't the fault of the family.\nPunish the rapist why the family has to bear the consequences? This is India not North Korea.,It was built on illegal land or smthng
Prove hua tha ki usne rape kiya tha ?,Checked 700 footages for proof then he was accused

"Thats a very deep thought actually, i kinda find it valid too.",I think you haven't seen other countries conditions
Best way to put it ....soch hi raha tha . The things I'm reading abt what's happening with Indians outside the country and the point is we can't even blame the other countries for thinking abt us like that .,"As a Bihari, I feel the same about Biharis in other states."
Mere per tale zameen hil gayi,Don’t give them ideas. Ispe bhojpuri gaana aa jaega with bhauji ki choli doing cameo
So Bihar is the India of India?,India is bihar of the world.
Bihar’s golden history in India is what India’s golden history in the world,"Yep, both are totally forgotten, & noone outside cares. Noone outside Bihar cares about Bihar's golden history, Noone outside India cares about India's golden history."
Don't worry guys I am here.. I will be the next pm I promise..,Are yogi ji aap?
not true indians working outside india are one of the richest immigrants 3% of indians in america generate 11% of the total income tax. and from what i have heard while indian tourists are pretty bad the resident indians are good and try to blend in the culture. india is not a liability on any country we are not living on aids or loans from anyone instead we are a prime place for investment and give out aid to other countries. i guess do not need to mention anything about bihar to tell how its totally opposite of what india as a whole is.,"•Same with Bihar and Biharis. No desired opportunity in state. \n\n\n •Moves out to earn money,or for educational purposes blend with culture.  \n\n\n•3rd gen Bihari, downplays 1st gen Bihari. (Similar to US citizen, Green card, H1B). \n\n\n •Proud Bihari, but will rarely visit Bihar.\n\n\n  •Will change polling constituency as soon as purchases houses in other states. \n\n\n •Purchase residential property near to airport in Bihar or in big city basically Patna.  \n\n\n•Will spend post retirement life in 3bhk but will never return to house with farms in native.(by then occupied by local relatives)"
OP Is stuck in 2008,Well you are stuck in the delusion created by our media
But nobody is giving us fuck ton of money though? Like how Bihar gets from centre,"It's just this once and it's purely for political purposes, saala independence se leke ab tak ek bhi dhank ke government nahi aayi hai Bihar, that's the reason we are lacking, Apne state Mai koi opportunities nahi, only options are to either live in Bihar being poor or move to another state for better opportunities, pure life mehnat karte hai bihari to escape Bihar or phir Raj thakre gaali dene lagta hai, just what are Bihari's supposed to do? \nThe fuck ton of money wouldn't mean shit coz the government has literally no plans in Bihar, unke agle 20 saal ka agenda (kaashi, mathura, ayodhya) Uttar Pradesh mein hai to voh Bihar ko kyu dekhenge?"

What he did was morally right at the time .. but if we think rationality he will be sentenced 12-20 yrs in prison so a life distroyer for him .. his family gonna suffer .. this is so fucked up just for the lust he lost his own life distroyer many others ...

He Wasted his life in doing so probably would be jailed ... If i were him I would beat the shit out of the guy and punch him to a pulp then bring him to the police station alive. He will think twice before committing something like that again.,"Do you really think such people learn from beating? Their own conscience couldn't hold them back. Also I wouldn't call it a wasted life, if it was for my sister I'd be very happy to kill that man and go to jail for life."

"Can't these female comedians crack joke without including boob,vegina, periods,bra,sux,hookup,women empowerment,condom,sux toys etc",Ye sab karne ke baad bhi funny nahi kar paati ek bhi
agar boys ko periods hote to kisiko pata bhi nhi chalta.. (:,Ulta smiley kyuu?  :)
Why are female comedians so bad?,Because there is female in it
bro honestly ye ladkia kaafi sympathy leti hai ke period naam pe matlab ki nature ne tumhe aisa banaya hai to deal with it apne tak hi rakho pura dhol kyu bajana hai ab ham ladko ko jabbhi tatto pe kuch lag jae ya fir public mein boner chupana ho to hum uspe sympathy lete hai?,Yes Bahaut baar public me tatto ko adjust karne ki problem hoti h
Bulle circumcise karte hai 1 saal ki umar me without anesthesia lekin kabhi sympathy nhi li,"Bro wo w choice karte hai, women ka system natural hai isliye only women sympathy leti ghumti hai"

Bassi(who's probably the most watched stand-up comic) ka entire stand-up career is based on Daru, berzogari, and college life Vella panti, and you guys roll and laugh because wo topic tumhare liye relatable hai.\n.\nMost male comics joke on how they were shit in school and how they bunked classes, pranked teachers, worked at a place they didn't like. Agar ye topics hatao to handful comics he bachte hai.\n.\nAs much as I agree that ye periods, vagina, boobs and stuff ke upar based jokes are repetitive so are jokes by most male comics. It all comes down to who you relate to more.","hasana ana chahiye, comedian koi intellectual nhi hota. bassi hasa sakta h sabko ye nhi hasaskti baat khatam.\n  \napne college aya tha bassi ekbar, ek launde ne pange lene ki try kari bassi ne usi par joke shuru kardiye pet dard karadiya hamara aur ye urooj ayi thi usse pehle vale fest me, ek launde ne slow clap kara, baaki log has nhi rhe the to chidhgyi thi vo ""guys come on"" vgera lol unlike bassi. talent ki baat h"

"Kind gesture, we should all get inspired to be like that guy but looks staged. Conveniently centre framed and guy happens to carry an extra raincoat with him, I mean comeon.","Right even I can't tell whether it's staged or not but at least it's not spreading hate, it's just a wholesome clip. innocent people who don't know much about this staged edited stuff can really get inspired for doing these generous acts of humanity."
Spreading these kind loving act of help are more appreciated then those Hindu Muslim hatefull videos,"You're right because nowadays social media, films, web shows really influence people, accept it or not. People believe what they see, even if it's edited. Especially teenagers can get the wrong influence easily through these platforms... So it's on us whether we spread love & Kindness or just hate & manipulation."

Why do ciggerate ads only show Mukesh 🐱,To be fair that bidi ad does show a woman dying
Does it really matter what is shown in an ad. It's just an advertisement. They just want to sell their product. If a men is living in rent with few mates there they have to wash their floor. It doesn't matters what the ad says.,"Correct. And all ad agencies usually do their homework to find and target the most common demographic. If studies showed them that most of their customers are gonna be females then it is what it is man. \nThey can't just abandon their major market to go ""woke"" xD"

Jack died trying to save her.,But two people could have fit on that one door. So jack was dumb and Rose was selfish. So Rose let him die. She was murderer. Dont try to fit it in the post im just talking about movie normally.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"lol,she was literally asked the history behind the painting,and was taken on a ship so that everyone could listen to her story,and jack wasn't a just guy who fucked her, he was her love and sacrificed his life to save her, so of course she is gonna remember him especially now that she was asked to tell her story...And Titanic is a great love story because it showed us that we should move on in life and not spend the rest of your life being miserable thinking about a lover who has sadly passed away...i never knew that reddit had so many incels","Don’t forget Jack didn’t just save her when the ship sank. He also helped to save her withering soul. When they met, her heartless mother was selling her off to an abusive and controlling man and Rose was on the verge of suicide. He showed her real love and offered her a life of freedom and real love.\n\nI’d never forget that person for the rest of my life, had I been Rose. Such incel takes on this, jeez."
Her hoe phase never ended,"Rose wasn't on her deathbed.\n\nShe was specifically called to discuss the drawing that was found in Titanic, the drawing of her that JACK made.\n\nYou wud've remembered it had u not been consumed by your hateful ideology"
They brought her to the ship for this very reason - to talk about the Titanic. I think that is bound to bring up some memories for her. Also I am not sure that she or anyone else knew that she was going to be dying soon. I could be wrong,"Not to mention she was on a sinking ship, a pretty crazy experience. No doubt there’s going to be complex emotions around it. \n\nPeople go so far out of their way to put down women. Like this gal is literally a plot device in a story, and somehow her actions reflect all women?"
Well he sacrificed his life for her 🤷🏻\n\n\n\nHe should be remembered,Bcoz she didn't share the raft with him but hogged it all by herself.
"""Titanic is a horror film because all the men died.""- Bill Burr. \n\nOf course women find it romantic because for them a man is appreciated only when he makes sacrifices for her. Lol. Ask a woman to describe her ideal man and the watch her describe a slave. \n\nAlso that raft was big enough for two. Rose was a selfish hoe.\n\nThough the Titanic in reality had a far more authentic and giving love story. That of Isidor and Ida Straus. The wife refused to leave her husband when the women and children were being evacuated. They died together when the ship went down. \n\nIronically her great grand daughter was Wendy Rush who was married to Stockton Rush the owner of the Titan submersible which imploded. Eerily creepy this story.",💯 Nothing more. Nothing less. This is the perfect answer
"Rose was saved by Jack while committing suicide. I hope I don't need to tell incels about how problematic suicide is since it is such a big problem amongst men themselves.\n\nShe had nothing to live for and Jack gave her a reason to live, a reason to love and laugh.\n\nNot to mention he again saved her life from the sinking ship. A big incident in which an engineering Marvel of the time got destroyed and 100s if not 1000s lost their lives. It was much scarier than what was shown in the movie, no lights, no way to know what's exactly happening in your immediate surroundings etc etc.\n\nAny person would remember such an incident as a matter of fact there entirely of that voyage had they been the survivor.",Absolutely correct..! Also they could be a great couple if he didn't die.. but as he died saving her atleast he has to be remembered. Also life moves on for everyone no matter what.. kiddos commenting here don't have the maturity to understand this..
Guys who can't get one girl don't want to think about a girl having 2 guys lol,"There's no need for that. Even if that's not what's happening, you have no reason to make fun of them for it. Do you have any idea of what it's like to live like that? To feel so alone? Unwanted? Unloved? I doubt it."

"the culprit is extra starch. you need to wash your potato in cold water and dry it on a cloth for atleast 30 mins and freeze it. take them out and straight into the fryer.\n\nIf you don't have much time, you can just par-boil the potatoes to remove the starch-> ice water wash-> fry.\n\nthis is what differentiates them from aloo bhujia to fries.","Yes and the fact they are different varieties of potato specially for fries,chips with required properties."
"Abbe mere to 2nd jaise hi bante hai aloo ko pehle 30% boil krke extra starch nikaal and always use Chipsona/Indori aloo(they have less starch), it will be perfect also remember har chamakti chiz sona nhi hoti mere bhai",Bhai aise bol rha hai jaise tera khud ka french fries ka food chain hai ...
I want to know the reason,"Too much starch.\n\nWhen prepping homemade fries, you need to soak em in a salt bath (ideally, overnight) drain em the next morning and you're good to go. Also, make sure they're fully submerged."
they use hydro a white powder,Isn't that just cocaine
I used to work in McDonald's and there is whole process of making fries.\n\nThey store it in freezer which is 4 degree celsius(main stockup). \n\nWhen they want to use they store it in container which is cold again.\n\nEmployees are trained to prepare amount of fries that is required and it will not get wasted. \n\nThere's machine for frying which will fry it exact 3 minutes. \n\nAfter frying they keep it in container which is always hot so what fries will not get cold.\n\nAnd there is process that if fries are there more than 15 \nminutes in that container then it's not a quality fries to serve and we used to waste it.\n\nFor delivery order we used to prepare new fries instead of packing old because minimum delivery time was 10 15 minutes so by then fries will get cold and customer might complain.,Konsa oil use krte McD meh ?
"get frozen french fries and then fry them,u will get the same as restaurants","Yep, because they are bleached out"

haan bsdk hindus to dont even talk shit about womens and rape bhi sirf muslims hi karte h. itna gawar kese ho skta h koi thoda sa bhi dimag nhi h kya. har cheez me dharm ko beech me lana.,"Your prophet itself raped a 9 year old , so its self explanatory about Muslim"
You are as bad as these guys for relating it to a specific religion. Don't forget how many muslims were awarded medals in the same Darbar hall of the Rashtrapati bhavan.

What does dedo mean?,Ye angrezi ke chode
It is sad that such news are just coming from Delhi .. if I am not wrong this is second incident that I have read in recent times… child labour is prevailing and no one is doing anything about this .. still Kejriwal says Delhi toh bht achha hai.. I think everyone forgot that these children are born by Labor but not For Labour !,"Bro, There are lot more news like this , where people are abusing house helps and watchmen."
Actually this peoplen dont cate about that little girl.  They just want to take out the frustration.  Many parents just give their kids  in Indoa to somewhere in big houses sobatleast she can to eat and shelter.,How does this affect the situation in the video ?
what if its a false accusation.. maybe they werent hiking tge salary then such act was construed to make them look guilty?? never ever support mob justice.. its all fine until it happens to yourselves.,You must be fucking idiot. Employing minor is punishable offence which they are already guilty of. Additionally the minor victims has burns on her hands caused by iron box. Even if you consider beating minor is false accusation but why hire minor knowing it is criminal offence?

[ Removed by Reddit ],Calm down my friend
"I was in middle school , it was a normal day at school i was happy , in the last period my teacher told me to meet her after class , i was like alright , maybe she wants help with upcoming sport event or something. I went to her in the last period and saw a classmate of mine with her who was crying , it wasn't in a personal classroom or anything, just like the outside assembly ground where everyone was running off so i was confused and asked the girl if she is okay and if someone hurted her , my teacher suddenly asked me to come to her and i was like alright i will ask this girl what happened afterwards, my teacher asked me if called that girl ""darling"" and tried to kinda SA her , i was in a state of confusion , my mind went blank , i was like what??!? but i was speechless for a moment , and with the confused look i glanced at the girl , she was smiling while crying alligator tears. I was a really sensitive guy back then and well i told my teacher i didn't but well the girl's friend also vouched for her and i had forever lost the respect of a teacher whom i really liked as a teacher. I cried that day a lot. Because that was my favourite teacher after my parents had left me alone and i was living on my own , i was really really innocent back then. Few days later i asked that girl in the ground respectively that why did she do this to me , she simply said ""I don't like you and it was fun"" while she walked with her friends laughing at me , everything went downhill for me after that , i got bullied a lot in middle school, enough to make me want to suicide but i had cute street puppies whom i had raised as their mother was squished under a car. I am in highschool now  , pretty good looking , i got friends now. I might have a few regrets about wasting last two years in depression and other stuff but well i have a chance to start over. Thank you for reading a fragment of my life story ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)","Hope, anything like that never happen to you again.

"Now if I were to play devils advocate here, I'd say that this stat is likely based on the number of reports that do not result in rape convictions, which is absolutely NOT the same as a false report.\n\n\nHowever, since OP has so kindly declined to provide a source, it's impossible to check....\n\n\nE: Jup, it's exactly what I said it was.

Indian women getting way over their heads these days.,Mostly cause are the simping men🤷‍♂️
A report I saw on news said about 90% of such cases aren't even reported in rural areas,"Yes, but who are they filing fake rape cases ??"
"It depends on what ""this"" refers to. Without more context, it's difficult to say whether or not someone deserves something. Can you provide more details?",Of course I'll. But for a sec just think about those men who get convicted for a false rape case. Is that fair ??
Lol sure. Source: trust me,"Comments padh leti, source mil jata\n\nWomen ☕"
"74% of reported\*\* rape cases.  \nGiven the number of cases that are not reported in our country, I wont be surprised if the number balances itself out..",That doesn't also mean that all those unreported rape crimes are done by man only

Also just see how Indian behaves infront of foreign girls like just bad stares trying to pick them up..Bro its all seen in movies that girls are easy to get but not in reality..They behave so desperate in foreign land..That's some of the reasons..List is long to go,"So true bhai,only mature comment in the comment section\n\nThis recent 'koreans are racist to indians' trend started when youtuber Nikita thakur posted her video raising this topic,and it went viral,it's the most popular video in her channel\n\nI think we are nit picking (like in Nikita thakur vid)and if one actually goes to South Korea (like my friend did) and even you have claimed to have been there,we won't face much racism"

Remember if you want to travel to a place or get visitors from a place you'll look at the negative portion of their society like imagine a Pakistani, so naturally people will defend it, also remember that Japanese girl that got harrased during Holi, the image you get when someone mentions Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Africa or even Mexico is not a pleasant one right same with India, I'm not supporting their racism I'm just saying this isn't blind hatred, this is cautious racism, the same thing we would have if someone mentions China or Pakistan. I'm not self loathing anti-Indian guy, I'm just a guy that is embarrassed by what some of the monsters in my country are doing and how it's affecting our international reputation.","This video has nothing to do with any of that.

Haa bhai India mein toh racism hai hi nahi,Toh iska mtlb teh hua ki hmme kisi teesre ya chauthe insaan se racism milna chahiye?

"so now our very educated and so called ""sanskari"" community kisi online doosre country ke ladki ko target karenge? besharmo tumhara hate itna kaise badh gya hai? radicalize tum muslim ko bolte ho khud itna radicalize kaise hogye?",Bhai opinion rkhne ko radicalism nhi bolte everyone in the comment is talking about the irony and this a memes page growup even muslims are taking the joke sportingly.

"Agar Mera goal hai ek healthy family basane ka toh in the long run emotional connection is what matters respect bhi tabhi aati hai..... Par agar tumhare partner ki tendency hi na ho iss sab chiz ki kyuki wo tumko uske first time se compare karti/krta ho tab kya kroge ? You will be mere a compromise to him/her. You want that? Absolutely no....... \n\nAs someone who priorities emotional connection, respect and loyalty the most virgin partner is all I would prefer, cause it's the easiest way to avoid unnecessary emotional baggage & comparison!!! \n\nHowever, if you're not virgin you cannot expect virgin partner because you two are different trains!...\nAlso mere hisab se jhoot bolne wale are the worst and deserves no good...",Also compare hona toh pakka hai cause first time is first time chhahe wo ladki ho ya ladka...

Roundhouse kick is always delight to watch.,Spinning heel kick you mean
The martial artist is a fool to be provoked by that looney for a battle. Clearly the guy who fell did not know a thing in martial arts but it was very childish at the part of the guy with the black belt to use his skills over someone who is just a half-witted overconfident man. Martial arts is not about kicking and flying but also using mind and patience,"Yeah, obviously in the video too it clearly looks like the guy is just playing around and he even said,“stop if I tell you to”."
i like how that guy ran to help him after knocking him out.,Maybe he shouldn't have wheel-kicked an obvious no-knowing loser like him in the face.
that kick might have been overkill. You dont want to be a muderder here,Pulling and yanking his spine around afterwards was overkill.

"Respect for that video taking man ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n""Jaat ka balak hu"" 🤣","In some ways if you think about it, he should’ve try to deescalate the situation by not provoking him. Not trying to take a stand for the accused here, but few folks wants to be a hero in this shitty social media world. In the beginning the way both of his mom and dad were trying to sort the situation was amazing. I firmly believe that the “tadka” in this whole video was that person who was taking the video. He shouldn’t be there if he don’t doesn’t know how to handle these situations calmly."

Locked him up to let him bleed. Perfect.,Its to protect him from the psycopath. They need to isolate the murderer first
What the actual fuck is wrong with this country,Post this video on instagram and people will start praising the father. Honor killings/assaults are still looked up to in this society.

Old kalesh - I know full story. Basically man is a officer in bsf and the woman with him in bed is teacher.his wife caught both of them and video got viral after that the teacher register FIR against the man family for beating her,How they barged in the hotel room? Was the door not locked
Kundi honi chaiye hotel rooms mei bhi,"Hoti h Bhai, inhone lagai nhi hogi, too much trust"
Why they keep the door open,Hotel walon se khulwaya hai..if the police comes to check the room..the hotel cannot refuse.
"How is policing doing this, entering their room without asking or even knocking. Is there not any law where the hotel cannot disclose any information about people staying in rooms or allowing anyone into their rooms?","Agar police aa gayi toh Hotel valo ko kholna hi padega kaise bhi, Hotel vale loge ki Privacy ke liye apna dhanda nahi band karvaenge."
baki sab to thik hai but isn't its crime to just pop up in someone's room,"If the police comes to hotel and is suspicious about a certain guest, then hotel has to comply. The wife in this case knew exactly which room his husband had booked."
No I am not fully satisfied.\n\nHe should be locked up and beaten everyday,Same he didn't get enough beating
 parents do not deserve kids,"Bro ,\nNobody deserves to be born in this world .\n\n10% you are lucky if you are born in a rich, upper middle income family .\n\nThe rest 70% are born in middle class households and have to work their asses off for living .\n\nThe remaining 20% are born in poor families.\n\n\nFactors also depend on gender( women have less opportunities in 3rd world countries like Iran , Afghanistan, Pakistan, India ,etc .)\n\nSome are born in war torn countries like Syria Yemen Libya Sudan Somalia etc…\n\n\nWhat did they do to be born under such circumstances?"
"Not satisfied. Both parents should have been medically fixed to prevent them from reproducing again- otherwise, just more kids suffering in the same hell.","Sadly, this is the reality of most poor people, especially in India. Kids get to live a hell on earth. That's why I never give anything to beggars, they will just reproduce more and will drag more innocent souls into this shithole."
This is Bangladesh if anyone's wondering,"Internet se bahar nikal bhai, it has nothing to do with the country. People like these are found everywhere aur usko Pela gya vo matter krta hai."
"Morally bohot sahi hai but ye vigilante culture sahi bhi nahi hai... Dude and his wife should be locked up by police not citizens. Warna mob ne habitat ki maar di, and ye vigilante justice movies me he thik hai real life me these things shouldn't be promoted.",I think u forgot which country it is nothing good comes by going to police most of the times.

Lmao ye chutiye convoys vaale full speed me daudate rehte hain gandu saale,Hana itne tej jarahe hai gandu sale Aram se jao bc.
Why weren’t they driving in left lane ?,"Then they'd have to wait for two more seconds and not speed around,  like in the movies, Esa kesa chalega. \n\nThe leading vehicle of the convoy took the wrong decision tbh. They would have inconvenienced everyone in the right lane if they'd succeeded, and no one would have blinked an eye.\n\nA lot of people use such shortcuts on desi roads other adjust according I'm not saying it's legal but it works."
unpopular opinion: she was not in the wrong,Yup people just love hating girls drive too much sometimes . and ye saleh convoy wala itna road apne baap ki samajh ke chalate hain
She conquered she flee,Tuti sabki haddi paslee
It's not the lady's fault. She had the indicator on and she didn't stop abruptly.,"Hate to be the devil's advocate but it's a double marked lane divider so one should consider it as a permanent divider and you're not allowed to cross it but it's India people just don't care or don't know. Technically neither of the parties (Scooty wali aunty and that commie CM's convoy) should have crossed the line. But maza bahut aaya, pata nahi kyun....ek  commie CM ka gand marte hue dekh accha feel hota hai."
"CM ka fir samajh aajata hai, he’s an important person to some extent. Ye lund lehsoon 2 kaudi ke ministers bhi itna lamba kaafila leke chalte hain and harass commoners.",UK ka PM ka bhi convoy sirf 3 gaadi ka hota hai but yahan toh har chintu mintu MP/MLA ko 15-20 gaadi ka convoy chahiye . Small PP energy on full display .
"I am just putting it there...there is a double yellow line... according to traffic rule double yellow should not be crossed. So legally the lady was in wrong.\n\nNow many will say ""This is India"" so we should expect and normalize and even victimize the ignorant (the lady) and say the minister or his convoy was wrong... \n\nSchool me 5th standard se traffic rule sikhana chahiye... Tab jaake 20 saal baad kuchh badlega",Convoy ne bhi toh cross ki hai
I mean looking at the video.. It is not her fault.. She used brakes and indicators before turning.. CM's convoy is in the wrong here.. Why were they driving like that in a congested road?,You are an idiot see all the upper comments
"I like how for women like these the interactive world is only in front of them and not behind, like video games don't render the world behind you until you turn around😭\nGirl didn't even bother to turn around to look at the mess she created","Na, she may not be driving perfectly but those politicians are speeding and trying to take over on a busy road. It's like they expect the whole world to leave the roads empty for them. Entitled fucks."
The fact ki vo larki was willing to take a lift from him shows ki how she trusted him...Ye teacher pakka class mai chilled aur cool type banta hoga to gain students trust and harress them....And Big W to the girl for recording it...This is why chahe kuch bhi hojaay never take a lift from teachers aur any other person whom you don't know personally,SEX EDUCATION BRO..

Why don't you guys on this sub ever mark NSFL on these animal abuse videos? \n\nIndians are callous and absolutely disrespectful in general about animal/child welfare and abuse but I've seen so many videos on Indian related subs where no effort is made to mark such videos nsfw/NSFL. \n\nPlease note that western platforms like reddit do not tolerate graphic animal/child abuse or violence. \n\nCould lead to the sub being banned.,Cause I mentioned it in the title itself?

"Combat training is absolutely necessary in a cesa pit country like ours.\n\nJordan Peterson is absolutely correct.\nBe a fucking monster and then learn how to control it. You should be capable of extreme violence. Most of what passes off as morality today is just obedient cowardice. To quote a motherfucker, Bhenchod tagde hone pe dhyan do, quite literally.\n\nBetter to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war, and on the streets of this shit hole, it's always war.\n\nThis sub made me take up combat training. I used to have a rest day on sundays , but i now go to the gym for plyometric and strength workouts. You never know when people gang up on you, or you meet a person as drunk on power as this dickhead.","Jordan Peterson lives in a civilised country where you can live your entire life chilling, following the law, minding your own business, and dropping bombs on countries from your office. He is not talking about fistfights. Even if you become a world class warrior all it takes to beat your ass is someone above your weight class, and if you're a heavyweight 6'2"", they just need 2-3 guys."

They all act like very normal people, they do luxury shopping, are very loaded people but how much power do you have to hold to not get behind bars when there are 100s of videos publicly posted online of you committing crimes, beating people, scamming people, openly giving death threats.

Safe sex ko itna demonize kar rakha hai. Agree it's not right for the age but the fact there is protection means usko besic sense hai. In sab cheezo me adults need to act mature handle the situation without traumatising victims. Let the principal be in jail.,"Bro 11th class ki ladki hai, 5th class ki nhi ki “it’s not right for the age”. Sex ke baare mai 8th grade mai padha dete hai, 11th class ka student using protection is a good thing, not a bad one."

Apne launde ko marna to bilkul sahi h but dusre bache ko marna is plain stupid even if in a fit of rage. Unless un bando ne unke (uncle) ke bete ko force kiya ho aane ko [which they didn't as is evident by the son's demeanor],. I would  rather someone else teach him the lesson on the spot. Nahin toh ajkal ke bachcho ke pas sabkuch hai siway accountability ke. On the spot agar action na lo toh bat ud jati hai.\n\nAlso this way you dont get awkward at home. Bahar se mar kha le aur ghar mein na batae kyunki wohi galat hai. Saap bhi mar jaye aur laathi bhi na toote. lol
"Apna beta peeta - W dad\n\nDoosro ke bachhe peete - L dad\n\nSimple.\n\nDiscipline ur kid, not others’","Not all cultures are alike.

All is fun and games until that BC is reality 💀,I see what u did there😁
"Lmafo. Beating your kid for doing something wrong will just instill fear and ensure that your kid does the same thing behind your back. \n\nUpar se doing this in front of other kids is cherry on the cake. \n\nAjeeb si parenting hai. \n\nMere maa baap ne kabhi merepe haat nahi uthaya after I turned 12. Smoking, daaru, hookah etc sab openly ghar par discuss hota tha. Never felt the need to be rebellious with my parents. Neither did I drink before I turned 18. Uske baad whenever I did go out for social events, I'd mention that I would be drinking. \n\nI turned out just fine. Never took up smoking nor do I drink beyond social events. \n\nParenting goes a long way in ensuring that your kid turns out sane. Beating them is never the right solution.","FINALLY!!! \n\nMy parents allowed me to go wherever i wanted and to do whatever i wanted to. Because of this i learnt on my own whats wrong what is right and where to go and where to avoid, never felt the need of doing stupid shit to feel rebellious. \n\nMeanwhile my friend's parents are really gusse wale and beat him up frequently and he turned out really worse than avg bigda hua bacha.. smoking drinking weed ruined him."
L Father \nhe's the reason his kid was there in the first place. \nyou treat your kids like punching bags and don't expect to rebel? \nBaap Bane se pehle dost ban chutiye.,"Exactly! Some voice of reason in here, thank you!"
context?,The kid lied to his Father on the _Telefoon_ about his whereabouts and was caught (prolly snitched on by some relatives on insta stories or live lol) then his father thrashed him and his friends
200% guarantee de raha hun ki ye launda phir se hukka piyega. Phir cigarette bhi piyega aur phir ganja bhi phookega. Agar iska baap isko sirf maarega aur gaali dega to ye kabhi nahin badlega.,Exactly. Baap ki izzat nahi karega. Maarna tha toh ghar leja ke maar leta. \n\nAb ke chup ke nashe karega lol. Kabhi sach nahi bol paaega.
Bhai aise kalesh nhi karna chahiye tha baap ko. Aulad hai toh matlab kya gundagardi chaloge? Tbh aise cases mein mostly bacha sudharta nhi hai ulta aur gusse mein aake aur chup chupke karega yeh sab. The embarrassment in front of friends and the public cannot 100% fix your kid's action. Not to mention ladke ke dosto ko marna was really stupid until and unless ladke aur uske dosto dono ne confess kiya ho ki his friends insisted him to come. Phir bhi dusro ke bacho ko Marne is wrong. Kya pta ab in friends mein se kisi ke parents complaint karde aur lafda hoga.,"Sensible comment. \nChup ke piyega, extra careful hoke jhoot bolega. \nRespect toh karega hi nahi. \nSach usse bola jaata hai jiski respect ho. \n\nBaap ko lag raha hoga kya bada kaam kar diya aaj toh.\nChildhood trauma de diya."
Handled very well. Kudos to TT!,About time somebody did something about this menace
"Man, this is really bad. Every time you look, these Muslims start praying anywhere, whether it's on the road or in a train. They do this in every public transport. Someone should ask them if their Quran specifically says they should only pray in public transport. Why do they do things that cause inconvenience to others? Now, no police action will be taken, and no one will say anything because they are a minority, and this is India, where everything goes. And if anyone is offended, I don't give a fuck.","1.you are supposed to face west while praying, how do these guys even know where west is when the train is moving all the time 😭\n2.You are not supposed to offer namaz in a way which causes blatant inconvenience to others(practice in private)\n3.There is no sin upon you to skip namaz when traveling.\n\nI don't know what's up with these guys on the train."
"As a muslim, these idiots lack civic and common sense both at the same time. It doesn't have anything to do with religion.",Exactly agar travel kar rhe ho toh namaaz baith k bhi padh sakta h ye bc train mein namaaz padh rha aur gaali sab muslim sunenge. Saale gadhe hein
Thought full thinking of op TT to confront them. \nThere is no need to offer prayer in a way that causes other inconvenience.,Muslim here & i agree a 100%
I think when you're traveling u can miss namaz it's legal so why do they have to do this,"Can't miss the opportunity to virtue signal others how pious you are and beeing in the center of attention.\n\n""Look at ME. It is all about MEEE!"""
Mulle madarchod,You don't have to blame the whole community.\nSoch badliye.
"Ok, a queer take on this video. These people have to congregate and pray at the same time and hence the area in between the aisles is kinda apt for it. 2nd, it literally takes 5-7 minutes for the prayer, pretty manageable time frame I guess for the other passengers or passersby, right? \n\n  \nFor any Muslims reading this, I am aware that one is not obliged to pray while travelling or they can should no show off/ cause inconvenience to others while praying but maybe their intentions are pure, who are we to judge?",No I dont even want this stupidity for 1 second. Pray at ur home.
bhai jo hindu train mein bhajan gaate hue jaate h noise pollution aur inconvenience to ussey bhi hota h. Sorry sach bol diya....,tru dono side hi wrong h agr muslim ko namaaz pdhte hue rok do toh kaafir or agr hindus ko bhajan gaane se mna krdo toh anti hindu mera mtlb loud music or loud speaker se h not in a negative way like agr aapki bhakti se kisi ko distubance hori h toh wo religious nhi pathetic h
"Yeah yeah stop a 2 minute namaz, which is a must to perform while standing. \nBut don't stop those hundreds of people who are traveling without tickets and blocked all the passages and decks.\nEdit: Wow 73 downvotes, Epic Indian mindset. Can't digest the fact. Just like their brother in Israel.",No one here is saying that Hindus without tickets should be allowed. What are you high on? Two wrongs don't make a right.
"He came between her and Steve. She says Steve WAS(dead?, Break-up due to something jadoo did?) her soulmate. OP chutiye video me almost poora context hai aur seedha bolta no context.","I don't understand what they are talking about, but from what I read on insta, she cheated on her husband with him as he (the guy in video) pretended to be a rich guy and later she found out he isn't rich and he's a delivery boy."
"It sounds funny to me to me when she entirely blames this guy as a sole reason behind her breakup with her soulmate. She is equally blameworthy because all of this had never happened if this woman remained faithful to just his soulmate. Therefore, breaking up with soulmate won't really affect her in the future, it never did or else she wouldn't have an extramarital relationship in the first place. She's just a gold digger and money mongering woman who'd probably move on to feeding on her next prey.",Kuch feminazi / bitchass vibes aa rahi hain memsaab se.. It seems like she usually has her way with this guy
Wait a minute doesn't this room look exactly like that legendary bangalore girl sari sex video.,Lemme confirm. Zara link dena toh
##We used to go in the same gym.Dude used to tell us that he is making money with bitcoin and this was during 2018 and showed us that he is living a dream life and flexed his friends super cars and told us that those were his .\n\nHe flirted with her and faked that he is super rich and showed her fake pics of him in other guy’s private jet. He also made a promise that he’ll marry her and this was when she found out that dude was a scammer.His dad has a lottery shop that’s all .,He was playing lottery in real life with this girl. 😭
DGAf about context but bdsm with her would be fun af :v,Aapda mein avsar 100!
That’s a disgrace on men. He stood there doing nothing and shamed all men.,Rape case kr dengi.
Arey randi chod di.\nAur randi is baat se gussa hai BULL paise wala nahi hai.\nTypical 95% AURAT jaat now days.,Jaato ki kya galti isme?
"The context:  \nThis is a 2016-17 video where the dude had promised the girl the world.  \nhe lied to her and claimed to be rich and she agreed to be with him.  \nwhen the truth came out (it eventually does) she took matters in her own hand and beat the shit out of the guy who lied to her.  \nNow the internet was in split (as usual) one who supported her - the one who did not support her.  \nthe fans who supported her said ' its ok for a girl to marry for money, it isn't wrong'  \nthe fans who were against her said, ' she was a gold digger and what happened to her is karma for being selfish'  \nI was in the former bandwagon where i believe, love is important but having a rich/pretty partner does help too and nothing is wrong in choosing a rich/pretty partner.","She cheated on Steve, plain and simple. Shes a whore. The guy didn’t ruin her relationship with Steve, she did. It was her choice. Fuck off from here with your logic lol"

People who have been abroad know how much people hate India and Indians. NGL incidents like these justify their hatred. \nTourism promote karna hai but safety security ke liye kuch nahi and har tourist spot mein scam hi scam bc,"Do you really think that people who did this, do care about all of these things, do you even think that they have little bit of civil sense and humanity inside them.

Very bad….Why cant people control their f**king hormones…Idiots.,"This is not a question of controlling your urges.

This is the thing that really pisses me off about this whole saga. So many people looked at it from so many angles but nobody brought up this point.\n\nSo now are we legitimising extra marital affairs now ?\nShe might be a gawar to you but this is a situation which everyone will face regardless of class if you live in a society. We have normalised adultery.\n\nThe very sacred nature of marriage is under threat if we don't even talk about this.\n\nMoreover another thing that isn't talked about is how she brought 4 of her kids which are also her ex husband's kids without his approval. She's a criminal and should be dealt with accordingly for that.,The funniest part was that she replaced the whole Jyoti Maurya saga. \n\nIg public ko bas lafda chahiye
So let me get this straight. What does she want him to do? Remain 24 hours with his wife. Not allow her to download apps on her phone? I can't get the logic here.,"I think she's trying to establish that if you are legitimising what Seema did, then he is also okay with the same thing when done by his wife.\n\nApart from that, i am not trying to justify either. I am way more done with this bullshit than a bull shitting the shit throughout his shitty life."

"The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called ""air""",Copy paste ke liye ek upvote isse bi dedo

First rule of street fighting - never land the first punch.\n\nIt could have gone way worse. People die in street fighting. Don't get encouraged by this. Next time your opponent might have a weapon.,"""never land the first punch.""\n\nBehind the scenes -\n\n![gif](giphy|1rM0WoXi1dpoIVZSID|downsized)"
"if he's tall, i would suggest next time go with the upper cut","sometimes you won't be able to cut distances with the tall guy as an opponent to having a place to uppercut. (Taller guys have wider reach)\n\nI would say, go to a medium range distance and 45° mein ek left body hook right below his right rib cage. It hurts like a bitch. \n\nFor a newbie, it will hurt right from the hit and will continue for hour and so. For experienced fighters, it will hurt a bit at start but they are tolerant for it and then at 2mins time, the body just freezes up from the liver shock"

Umm why is the dog attacking the kid and not her mother? Like I have seen feral/ pagal kuttee and they attack blindly but this dog seems to be only targeting the child?,The dog is seeing the kid as an easy target/food. Some rare wild dogs attack kids bcz food.
"I have three dogs at home! Love for dogs on street being kept aside, such dogs must be put to sleep! And no activist must raise voice against such violent behaviour! Such wild ones must be taken down!",Totally agree. There's a limit to what can be considered tolerable. This behaviour of the dog comes nowhere near being acceptable.
Kaha hai madarchod Dog lovers,yeh rha main dog lover\n\nbut ye kutta thoda mentally psychotic hain \n\nso at this point he is just like a psycho person
Ab iss dog ko marenge to kutta bachao cummunity aa jayegi.!,"Haan bc chutiye sale, aadmi se jayda unhe kutto ki padi hai"
"I'm a dog lover but with a single rule...if a dog becomes this violent he's done in this world.That's it.And for pets..the rule is simple, if you can't break the neck of the dog in case he attacks someone... don't keep it as a pet.",I have one more month validity for rabies vaccine. If a dog pet/stray attacks me/someone in my vicinity it is dead for sure.
Street dogs in our residential areas are a real problem which has to be dealt properly.,Kill them before they kill someone else
where are those animal sympathisers?,Are you mentally lacking ? Animals that attack humans are to be put down. Animal cruelty is bad. These two lines of thought can exist simultaneously.
Gali ke kutto ko koi Aisa drug dena chahiye Jo unko bohat maza dila de fir use maza ke bitch me he unko mar dena chahiye. \n\n1. Vo kutte ke jindagi waise he assan nahi hai itna pleasure ke bad vo mar bhi Gaya to usko ghanta fark nahi padega \n2. Ye unke aur hamare dono ke liye best hai \n3. Vo kutta aur 10 saal bhi jee le to itna khush nahi hoga jitna vo drugs ke bad hoga to it doesn't matter.,Bro punjab se ho kya

"Problem is not that he was called out chapri, problem is, that he was called out Chapri in front of his gf...that too by a kid LOL.",Beefing with a kid isn’t going to help his cause. That girl is she is not a chhapri is going to take a  look at him again and decide. Chances are both are alike so.
Some of these comments are from kids who got away with this kind of stuff and now justify it,"Yeah seriously, like why tf are people tryna justify the kids action, just bcz he looks in a particular way?"
I'm speechless at many of the comments supporting the kid.,"Wahi to, what's wrong with these people."
Gen alpha brats are assholes fr. I don't interact with kids because some of these mfs are straight up arrogant and if you engage in verbal spat with kids you an adult will become laughing stock so it's better to ignore.,"Dude, a few days ago i was on a night walk with my girlfriend. And this group of 8 year olds on bicycles approached us and started harassing us, which wasn't too serious as we thought they were just teasing us. Then one of them crossed the line by screaming something really horrid as we were walking away from them. I picked that kid up by his collar, threw his bicycle in the middle of the road and threw him like 5 feet away. Held him by the neck and made him apologize to my girl.   \nWas contemplating my choice of actions when i came back home, but knowing about all these pieces of shits of society I now think I should've taught him an even harder lesson"
"A man with a 200rs meesho chain on his neck, beefing with a kid, is never defeating the chappri allegations lmao","He can wear whatever the fuck he wants chahe 200 ki ho ya 2 lakh ki, baaki who tf is that “kid” to call anyone anything"
"Not gonna lie the dude does look like a ""chapri"" ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)","Just bcz someone looks like that doesn't mean kids should name call him a casteist slur, imagine you are just minding your own buisness and then random mfs start calling you chapri."
"The rider was on bike without helmet, so I don't see the kid as wrong here.","I see the girl has 2 helmets in her hand, means they had helmet.\n\nI wont be too quick to judge here because there’s possibility of him hurriedly getting on bike to catch up with the bus. They were also recording, means the namecalling started before only."

"just a kid following his father's instruction. I wish he realise this soon, he is not a son but has been converted as \*religious puppet by his father.",\*cash cow\n\n  \nno puns intended
"For those who dont know the guru, this legend is Rambhadracharya. Knows 22 languages, absolute prodigy since he was a child.\n\n[wiki page](","Hard to believe the blind guru who had no education could formulate poems at age of three and memorized 10k verses of ramayan by age 7. \n\nHe must have exceptional memory and gifted intellect which could have been used in the fields of science for the advancements of the society, he could have achieved such great things if he was in a forward looking field, but instead he was pivoted towards memorising ancient verses which did no good in a practical way. Sad state of our society.\n\nIt's very important to pivot kids towards modern science which points at the future and not into established things/ stories from the past, which today we can find by a few taps anyways. But the guru made the best out of what he had and runs schools for the blind which is a Chad move.\n\nBut kudos to the guru, even with no eyes he can still notice this kid.but if he is completely blind, why is he turning his head towards the kid and asking him to get down ? Makes no sense"
Extremely satisfying that a conman was schooled well by a person with some spine . This kid really making a joke of true meaning of bhakti . Just can’t express my satisfaction levels in words,The real conman is his father who is making him do all this bs
I always thought that guru ji was completely blind...but now watching him abstaining the kid from coming near him proves that it's the people who follow the kid on social media are the real ones who are blind.,"Partial Blindness bhi kuch hoti hai, Agar Thoda Bahut padh liya hota, to ye Comment ki jarurat nahi padti."

Bagha jis lifestyle se Mumbai mein jee rha hai uss lifestyle se to mera engineer bhai bhi nahi jeera. Uska ghar bhi bagha ke ghar se chota hai. Abhi bhi single hai.,"As jethalal once said ""tumhe pata hai uski pagar kitni hai?.... tumse jayada hai"""
Babita anjali ko same size aajata hai pehle yeh sawaal ka jwab do,"Stretchable t shirt hai, free size hota hai, to aa hi jani chahiye"
Also feel bad for Iyer when he is not included in any foreign trip.,"After learning that he is not married IRL, it really hurts hard"
"Hate him cause he cannot see that his wife reciprocates with the flirting and used to love it in the older times. Bro deserves a better life partner, someone like Madhavi.",Yes madhavi is a very good wife indeed.. supports the family in every way possible
"Jethalal - pervert\n\nMehta Saab - supports a pervert\n\nSodhi - drunkard\n\nBhide - failed financially (struggles for her daughter's diwali shopping)\n\nDr. Hathi - foodie af, f\*cked up body\n\nPopatlal - Dedh pasli, Unmarried (out of competition)\n\n👑Educated, well mannered and gentleman IYER is the winner 👑",Bidhe did not fail financially he is an extremeist
"Babita even avoids touching him even while acting. Read again, i didn't say, she doesn't touch him, i said she avoids. It's visible in many episodes which results in slightly bad chemistry compared to other couples.",I never felt they had any chemistry at all. I feel like their marriage is more of an arrangement than convergence
Racism on peak. Jethya (a fair guy) flirts on a married woman is fine which is actually wrong. But Iyer (a dark guy) protects his wife is considered an idiot. \nDUNIYA HILA DUNGAA!!!!!!!!!\nYEH SHOW CANCEL CANCEL CANCEL!,"😂🤣🤣 tbh I feel if you get a guy like Iyer, life is sorted cuz he's really a gentleman! 🙌🏻💯"
People literally support jethalal for creeping on someone's wife and even so called educated mehta support him in it,The wife isn't innocent either. She absolutely loves the attention that society males give her lol. \n\nIyer deserves a better wife
Who hated him 😭😭 He is the character that has entertained all of us so well throughout the show!,Not us but normally who just is new to the show and a majority of people
"The problem is not that he is protecting his wife. The problem is that he is passive aggressive towards jethalal where he appears to be a petty person. He should first address the matter with his wife and then properly confront jethalal. If he just wants to engage in petty behavior, people just enjoy the fight",Its a comedy show..not a melodrama…go watch ekta kapoor shows if you want melodrama
"Yes Tmkoc wale dusre ki biwi par line maarna ,attraction rakhna yeh sikha rahe hai aur abhi tka bhi chalo starting meij aise comedy shows log nahin dekhte thei saas bahu serials ka chalan tha tabh yeh aise element daalna taaki log dekhe chalta tha lekin ushe continue rakha kyun rkaha vah ab pata chal raha hai jha Asit ki tarah tarah ki baatein saamne aa rahi haji","Ye shuru me fir bhi chhota sa scene hota tha wo funny bhi lagta tha, badme to bada ajib ho gaya jaise sare kaam chhod ke babita ka kaam karne ke liye bhagna, bday ka pata chalte hi bhag ke wish kar dena wo sab, aise kaun karta hai"
They hate because he being Tamil is opposing a Gujrati protagonist.,Of course the producer is gujarati
Ok but when did Iyer ever try to protect his wife from Jethalal?,"Everytime, everyday. Eyeing someone else wife is wrong in every aspect, plus: hating Iyer out of jealousy is also wrong and not justified. Jethalal is a creep"
"Forget about hugs, Babita doesn't even touch him 😑","Ikr I remember that bhootni waala episode, all of women held their husband's arm but Babita only Iyer's shirt"
Hugs received from babita \nJetha-1 iyyer-0,"In real? I can remember at least 3 times Babita hugged Jetha,but those were all in dreams. Did she hug him in real?"
,Aur koi chara hi nahi hai bhai
He won then <3\n\n,but at what cost..
 kya baat karre ho?  \nYeh wala hug surpasses any hug that has ever been or ever will be.,"Emotions kaha hai ? When Madhvi or Mrs Roshan hugs their husbands, you can feel the emotions... but not here."
He won,"Ah yes, we meet again."
The fact that Babita calls her (on screen) husband by his last name is itself stupid. She acts if he is her roommate and nothing else.,"Yeah lol.... Bijay sharma, a man lives near my house... I am imagining if his wife calls him sharma ji 😂 how funny it will be 🤣"
"Should've put Ahmedabad, that is sincerely and religiously over hyped every time its on screen. They will literally show montage of various shots from a broken roundabout to dirty sidewalks and stray dogs and play ""He Heeeee.... Khana Peena Khulke Jeena...🎶""",Itna romanticize toh log Mumbai ko bhi nhi karte
Non veg is completely missing. Babita doesn’t eat fish. Sodhi doesn’t eat butter chicken. Even Abdul doesn’t eat non veg. No other marathi dish other than Kothimbir Vadi. No other Punjabi dish other than Aloo Paratha and Lassi. No other south Indian dish other than Idli. Only Gujarati dishes are unnecessarily overhyped in the show.,"my headcanon is that Champak has banned sex, non-veg and alcohol in society"
They talk about being mini India so much but they rarely go deeper than surface level for other states culture....,"Yea, no pahadi in the sociiety"
"Overhyped\n\nKabhi aur states ke food ki baat hi nahi karte, example) Dosa, Chole Bhature ko kaun takkar de sakta h?",Vahi to jab dekho jab gujrat gurjat\nAur hamesh garba garba\nBc ek episode me gogi bolta hai bhangda karte hai to sab mana kar dete hai aur 2-3 sec ke bad daya bolti hai ki garba karte hai to sab garba karne lag jate hai\n\nTMKOC ke according bad gujrati culture best hai\nBaki Indian other states ke culture chutiya bekar hai\nFood ki bat kare to gujrati food se achha North Indian aur South Indian hai idli dosa chhole rajma etch
I never liked jalebi fafda ate twice and nah it's not my type. The show has insanely marketed jalebi fafda to the next level. I didn't like how they stereotyped each family like a south Indian only eats idly and a punjabi aloo Paratha but when it came to jethalal family they showed wide variety of dishes.,"kabhi aao rajkot side pata chale chole bhature ke bahar ki duniya\n\nbarf ke gole se lekar chai se lekar full thali , khair tumlog ke liya gujarat ka matlab ahmedabad hi rehta"
"As a Gujarati I agree......Tmkoc has overhyped the Gujarati food.\n\nJalebi-Fafda, Undhiyu, Thepla are goated and fairly hyped but apart from that the majority is overhyped.",Bro isn't Jalebi fafda overrated too . I as non gujarati like dhokla thepla undhiyu. But don't know why jalebi fafda always doesn't give satisfaction
"I am a real life victim of this. My college gang had a night out at my Gujarati friend where his wife hyped Jalebi Fafda as the breakfast for next morning. Everyone was like woow TMKOC wala nashta milega. Cut to next morning after having it for breakfast, me and my others non gujju friends were looking at each other thinking wtf was this. And we weren't even full.",fafda is really so overhyped
"Sahi bat hai, maine bhi try Kiya hai bahut bar lekin achha nhi laga",yess i felt it was too dry and bland
You’re having the wrong Gujarati food then. I visited Gujarat recently and fell in love with the food there,"You know that other people who visited Gujrat still don't like their food. For me its Rajasthani food, visited Rajasthan for 4 times now and still don't enjoy their food but like the people their and their tourist places."
Iyer Idli real id se aao,Mai Marathi Manus hu bhide /s
i mean as gujarati i disagree because \n\ni feel is not overrated its fairly rated,As a food critic in agree that it's fairly rated but they overhyped it
Itnaaaa kya sweet bhai... Vada pav mitha khilaya hain gujrat mein mujhe,Tumko iyer ki tarah mirchi khani hai kya
gujju food real life me bhi op hai tu ab bikenar sweet se dhokla kha ke bol raha hai accha nahi hai,Accha he but thoda sa overhype to he
Bro is a bakchod who never tasted any Gujarati food and just started yapping on the sub I am not a gujju but I like Gujarati food it is a heaven for vegetarians with unlimited options in veg,Seriously op is chutiya
Something as basic as jalebi fafda is hyped to the point that as if it is superior then chole bhature aur samosa,It is. Have it with the kadhi and the sambhara. It's heaven. Chhole bhature is just masalas. You wouldn't eat it if the actual taste of the chhole overshadowed that of the masala. Same w samosas.
Even in one arc they were all bored from their life and decided to do something exciting and the master plan finally was to make umbadyu or something weird dish and celebrate as if it's some top tier dish.,"It is lol, try it in a place that makes it in the most traditional way with the hole oven in the ground and the upside down pot."
"I've been to big fat gujarati wedding as part of my work and i've tried their dishes, trust me its so bad (i can't use word like garbage because it's food) and while I'm living in Surat and they put CHEESE in every dishes and when you ask for spicy it tasted even more sweet. It's so bad that a colleague of mine bought some sabzi and I ate my parathe with it because it was sweet like ketchup. And while we're at ketchup, these people pour (yes pour not dip) ketchup on vadapav, pasta, pizza, soup and on everything. It's so disgusting that I have to sit far from them. And lastly there are around 10 shops in whole Surat who serve non-veg and that sucks too.",Leave the state no one forcing u my hater boi\nThings u have mentioned are purely false
"As gujarati I agree, it's fully carb loaded with the same thing in different textures","Bro besan ni vaat hu maanu, but ketla shaak chhe, ketli curries chhe, ketla dishes chhe judi judi"
"sahi me bc , har cheez me cheeni , butter aur cheese hota hai sirf .\n\nmujhe to fafda ke baare me pta hi tmkoc se lga tha","Fast food ke alawa try karo kuch, butter aur cheese yehi log dalte hai bisi even gujarati people hate it. Pr yeh amdavad k logo ne overhype kr diya hai cheese butter ko."
"Tum sab kabhi bengali food kha kr dekho\n\nYe log bengali food k naam par sirf baingan bhaji aur rasgulla dikhate hai \n\nHamare ghar me jab bhi gujrati foods ko overhype krte hai sab k sab log bolte "" inn log ko ye achha lagta hai?? ( no offense) ""","Because bengali food includes nonveg and according to tmkoc logic, nonveg = duniya ka sabse bada aparadh, so they won't show proper bengali food."
This show has officially become a parody of itself.,"It reminds me of a moba game which is hyped by its player base (almost to the extreme point of toxicity) and the developers would simply copy their characters from other games, animes and historical figures.\n\nSo a couple of years ago, the developers started to reskin their own game characters and releases as new characters which is ironic in a way"
"that was illogical too, he must have traveled too far by camel to reach Pakistan.",It was illogical but atleast it was funny unlike current episodes
Iss show mein baap-bete dono hi har@mi hue hain,Bahu aur Pota bhi kam nahi hain
"Finding logic in this illogical shituation but \n1. Why didn’t the balloons self deflate overnight?\n2. How did he travel so much distance overnight just with some helium balloons🤡🤡\n3. If he was over sea, why didn’t he not let go of balloons when it was kinda shallow water",Ngl why didn’t noone shoot off some balloons like what pak army did lmao
Where did the storywriters go....Those who produced such W plays were great,"Writers have become lazy. Govt job jaisi security mil gyi film industry me. Aur kya chahiye unko, jo mann me ata h likh dete hai. Paisa leke mauj karte hai bc."

Ab bolo tmkoc ka cultural impact nahi hai dhekte hoo kitna bda show hai,Kohli did Gangnam style celebration in 2013. Iyer did this in 2025.
"well i think ye step zyada famous tab hua tha jab comedy nights with kapil m ssudhesh lehri koi old lady banke aata tha tab karta tha , mujhe yaad h school m sab copy karte the",It was ali asgar but nice that u know that
How the hell did Bhindi Master pull this off?!☠️,Bhindi Master for a reason

Atmaram Tukaram bhide,Gokuldham society ka ekmeev secretary
We want the Abdulisation of Abdul back!,yeah and matka king too
Character so powerful that makers needed to nerf him,Abdul hai ya Aurangzeb 🫣
"Abdul Tapu sena se bada hai, phir bhi vo use bhai kehkar bulate the , agar uska society me flat hota to ye use bhi uncle hi kehte",pehle toh bhai bhi nahi kehte the. Aye abdul tha bas
I hate this cringe edits,Yeah. It's so awful.
"1. Downfall of Daya being a savage.\n\n2. Downfall of Jetha not criticising Sundar right on Daya's face. All he did after the first 500 episodes was baat badal dena after Daya said ""hmm? Kya?"".\n\n3. Downfall of Babita not flirting back to Jetha. They turned Jetha into a proper simp. It used to be a proper flirtation in both ways before.\n\n4. Downfall of Tapu being an actual asshole, rather than his silly shararat and then his supermangiri because dadaji ka beta.","5. Iyer being pretty okay with hindi speaking. Initially he wasn't able to speak hindi and that was his shtick.\n\n6. Though Sodhi had some caricaturish expressions, he was not a stupid sardar like they have made him now... He used to show all the emotions. Now he is always bubbly and seem like high on cocaine.\n\n7. Bhide in initial episodes never liked Champak Chacha. For him champak was the most illiterate and unfit for society's norms.\n\n8. All the women of society were not friendly with each other. They used to roast each other and all of them used to have some motivations of their own... Only voice of reason was Anjali and that was her trait. She was not annoying for diet food too.\n\n9. Popatlal was not simp and despo for marriage in his introduction years. They later added that to his arc.\n\n10. Tarak used to break 4th wall in mod episodes too.\n\n11. Nattu kaka was not just obliging employee of Jethalal. He was menace in himself who used to ignore kaam ki baat by saying aapne kuch kaha seth ji?\n\n12. Bagha being a roaster to whatever he is today."
Wo bjp ki sarkar aagyi na isiliye. 😶‍🌫️,Yeh show k starting k 3 saal k andar hi shayad aisa ho gaya tha abdul change ho gaya tha
"He actually looks so handsome and mature now, imagine he was still on the show till now, would be clean shaved and playing ""balgeet"" with nalli sena🤡",Truee...he left the show at the right time
"Purana Tappu toh bada ho gaya, khud 2 bachchon ka baap lag raha hai, lekin Ashit ne tmkoc mai abhi tak Tappu Sena ko bachcha hi bana ke rakha hai.","Uska 1 Gujarati picture bhi dekha tha maine... He was very good in that...\n\n""Pappa tamne nahi samjhaay"""
Shailesh Lodha just killed it wit his acting,Ikr bhai.. i stopped watching once they replaced mehta sahab.. ye kahase chomu dhundhke laate
Ab bhi har jagah yehi chal raha hai... Har state ko bas language ka hi issue sabse main lag raha hai... Concept of country is no where to be seen,In bjp era no one will create this type of episode
miss those episodes where tarak was the only wise man in tmkoc!!see champaklal in the scene!! learning how to do hriday parivartan,Free ka Heart Transplant karta hye champak chutiya
If this episode was created today there would've been burning statues of Shailesh Lodha and he would receive death threats 🤡,Dharm ke Shoorveer would go RAAHHH 🤡
The only hriday parivartan that's still hits hard.,The only hriday parivartan which pariverted everyone's hriday
Is it that arc when Tapu Sena found Param Veer Chakra and then the society searched for it's awardee who was an ex-colonel and threw it away then they gets the awardee onboard for Republic Day celebration though he was reluctant join them and he again gets angry seeing them representing themselves from their states and was about to leave but they realise mistake and finally makes him accept his Param Veer Chakra?,"Nope, it is an earlier arc/episode."
u/instaisbest do you like this post?,"Yes bro, pehle taarak mehta ek bohot bada writer tha ab aisa lagta hai jaise koi corporate majdoor ho"
Toh fir mehta sahab woh jethalal ko thode manners I mean dusre ki patni ko pervert ki tarah tadna thoda ajeeb nhi hai,Jethalal is a shady character it has been known from the beginning and not everyone in that show is morally great guys like they pretend to be nowadays. And it's nothing wrong to like an attractive female and Jetha doesn't misbehaves with Babita anyway.
"shailesh lodha had aura, which present joker can't ever match it.",U can't call someone a joker just becoz he is playing a role of a main lead who was played by someone else.\n\nI agree shailesh lodha had an aura he was on a whole different level than these new actors.\n\nThe new actor is also trying his best.\nDr hathi was originally played by the same person who is now portraying but just becoz we have seen kavi kumar Azad ji we don't like anyone else playing the same role. The new hathi isn't criticised much becoz we all know that he cannot come back The same goes with the new nattu kaka \n\nI agree that the producer sucks but we can't change him\n\nConclusion: I just wanted to say don't call anyone a joker unless you know much about him
Itna kharab ho gaya hai ki direct naya to dekha hi nahi ja sakta.. koi regular dekhta aa raha hai uski baat alag hai.,I switched to 1 min episode on Reddit 😂
Because creators behind SVS (Hatss Off) aren't one trick pony. They have created\n\n* Jasuben Jayantilaal Joshi Ki Joint Family\n* Baa Bahu aur Baby\n* Khichdi\n* Mrs Tendulkar\n* Bha se Bhade\n* Badi Door se aaye hain,"Right now they’re running Wagle Ki Duniya. I like that show as well. Variety in storylines, focus on various major and minor topics, mainly character growth and evolution"
"After watching a horror movie, my friends and I watch old episodes of TMKOC just to reset our brain.\nThe new episodes are like that~ you don’t wanna watch with an open eye, but you also don’t wanna miss anything.\nAnd after it’s over… we’re just staring like wtf was that and need to watch the old episodes to reset our brain",yeah like white noise
FIR too died a hero,Not really. It downgraded when they turned it into a daily show rather than being weekly or biweekly. They also saw a dip when Kavita Kaushik left.
Also badi door se aaye hai \n\nSumeet Raghvaan worked in 2 shows and finished them but still tmkoc hasn't ended \n\nKeep in mind that he is working in Waagle ki duniya too \n\nSame goes for other shows which started and ended but tmkoc hasn't,Badi door was a gooood show. I enjoyed it
"tmkoc wont be this popular if they stopped after 1000 or even 2000 eps.\n\nthe new eps keep the show alive in some way, however bad they may be.","Exactly, one of the reasons why tmkoc is still so relevant is because it's still running, if it had stopped there wouldn't be such a big comunity on reddit for the show"
"Idk what's wrong with asit modi bro isn't stopping even after people are saying it should stop hess he just wants to drag it till he makes and brakes records no storyline ,no humor plain 20 min crap",Acting of that new Roshan is pure crap. Can’t even stand her voice🥲
Sarabhai v Sarabhai was no way near TMKOC old episodes,That shit was the most goated hindi sitcom.
Agreed. But TMKOC has to be applauded coz they kept us entertained for many years with almost ~2K good episodes,True I wouldn't say 2* I would go only till 1000 episodes though but still theres a vast difference between 70 goated episodes and 1000 goated episodes.
"Stop overusing this fu*king quote , tired of seeing this everywhere.",Stop seeing everywhere bud
I miss those old abdul shop late night gossips of Purush Mandali reminds me of my 8th std when i used to come back home and watch tmkoc,"Unironically this show had that feel that you're living with them it used to give that sense of comfort even in tough time which this show lost,old episode are still great but don't hit the same"
Can someone give me the name of this particular bg music.,I Don’t think you’ll find it anywhere. It was produced for the show.
"backstory of this scene\n\nremember an episode where bhide was getting emails about money and he sent so much money after reading the emails? this is the very scene! when the scammers said him taht to secure his money, he need to send some more money and after sending him, he was like ""now i am tension free"" .\n\ni miss those days 😭😭😭",Jackpot bol deta to bhi smjh jaate
Need to be longer,tru bhidhe feet pic 🔥🔥
Life before 2015,Sach me bhai :')
Why always bhide?,"He kind of represented more or less the middle class. He had a strong moral compass that drove his actions. He would also, at times, fall into traps or his own greed. He represented the ideal person, not someone without flaws but someone who will fix them."
Sitting like that on that chair takes some balls,Why though? I sit on mine just like that
Bro ye music kab play hota tha I think i forgot,Galti realization hone par bure time me hosla dene par
 matlab kuch bhi dikha rahe hain ye log,Antu tu idhar 🤣🤣
Why you guys even watching new episodes???,Koi replacement batao tmkoc ka khana nahi khaya jaa raha
Is this sub a facebook page now? 1like = XXX bs,But I feel like slapping asit modi...no bs in that
bhai galti humhari hai cuz we r the ones who still watch this shit show,Don't use we bcz all my friends and cousins left watching the latest episodes and watching repeat telecast and internet pe downfall of tmkoc dekh ke lag raha sab Aisa he kar rahe
WHAT IN THE FUCKING BHOJPURI FILM INDUSTRY IS THIS,Don't disrespect the Bhojpuri film industry like this.
Writers don't realise the tremendous strength it requires to even be able to hang like that plus champak is easily 70+ and skinny barely any muscles.,"Hanging is easier if you're skinny, tbh. But this is outlandish."
Ye naye writers ne kya old episodes dekhe bhi h kya...kuch bhi likhe ja rhe h...kabhi ekdum logical likhte h...kabhi ekdum illogical\n...purane episodes me sab sath me chalta tha...puri story me mst comedy krte the..last me thodi samjdaari...fir vaps naya funny arc...\nIsse acha to tmkoc ke fans se scripts likhvaao...dialogues likhavo...purane episodes vala maja aaega,logical kab likha new writers ne
Ye sapna hua to 🤔🤔,Illogical cheezein sapna nahi hoti Tmkoc mein bhai
Bhadwo ne AI ke zariye bakchodi karna chalu kar diya hai,They can fire all the writers and AI can write a better script than this.
I watched this show back when I was 8 for the first time. It was fun watching this show that summer. I knew this was an old show but WTF!!!! IS IT STILL GETTING AIRED LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL FLUFF IN THAT FLUFFY CUTIE PIE DOGGO SHIT IS THAT??,I AM TURNING 16
Achchhe hua karte they humare zamane ke tmkoc episodes.,The fact ki aaj tak bhide ko nahi pata he was helped by jetha is the best thing of this plot
But still doesn’t want such in laws and family for her daughter 😏,Bcz he doesn't know that and thinks that gada family is problematic
"Uss din bhide ko pata chala ki kitna hi gyani banke gyan ch*d lo, Bina paise toh bhikari bhi dua nahi dete🤌","Usko gyaan dene yani padhane ki wajah se hi paise milte hai, usko khudke ghamand ki wajah se struggle nahi karna pada tha, wo to uske students ke bhadwe parents ne payment rok kar rakhi thi wo bhi tyohaar ke time pe, otherwise uske pas paise hote."
"Wait a minute, guys! I just realized something after watching it for the third time randomly. If Jethalal is asking that lady to place an order worth ₹20,000 from Bhide to benefit him, the one who actually benefits the most is the lady herself. She’s essentially getting ₹20,000 worth of pickles for free from Jethalal, while Bhide only earns a profit on the ₹20,000 sale.",Yeah kyun bhide ko aise hi to paise nhi de sakte because
After all desh ke sbse famous show me itna iconic character kiye hai bhai itne saalo tak,"His legacy is more than that. He had appeared in approximately 100 Gujarati and Hindi films and around 350 Hindi television series. He also acted in more than 100 Gujarati stage plays and has dubbed more than 300+ movies in gujarati. Our prime minister being a gujarati, most likely has seen many of his works and might be his fan."
Who is the second actor he's talking about?,May be hathi bhai . Kavi Kumar Azad
Nattu Kaka's character was so wholesome and I can't remember any dull scenes of his. Such an iconic character and performance from him.,"Fantastic actor and well written character too, he fully deserved a pagar raise."
Don’t know why this on my feed. But does that dude in orange have black spray paint for his hairline? Lmao,"This is a Hindi language comedy show based in Mumbai, which is the longest running sitcom of India. That orange man is bald but somehow he wants to retain his hairline in the show."
What's up with that black smudge on Bhide's head?,Hair color hai bhai
Literally nothing funny and the dialogues feel so blend. No emotion from any of them like old days!,Bro watch the full clip
Man I was searching a bit on indian/hindu culture... and....\n\nHow did I get here????  And WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE AWFUL MUSTACHES????,"No, this is a Hindi language comedy show based in Mumbai, which is the longest running sitcom of India."
"Natukaka was a fun character. My fav episode of him is when he explains his horror story to jethalal during the bhootni arc, The horror sounds he makes "" bhootni bhagi jaao"", his evil laughs and everything was so funny.\n\nMonika Bhadouria, who played Bawri, disclosed that he was mistreated on the sets. I don't know how much this is true.  \n\n🤎 u natukaka","Bhagi ja re bhoot bhagi ja re, Bhagi ja re bhoot bhagi ja re"
"It's disrespectful how they decided to replace this actor.\n\nThey should've ended this character and should've introduced a new character instead.\n\nThe new nattu kaka's whole arc is so irritating to watch.\n\nFor this, Fuck You Asit Modi 🖕","They did , the new nattu kaka is his friend"
He deserved a better farewell on the show,Sadly he was not treated well in sets
I read somewhere that even in his last days of coming to shoot they (show makers) misbehaved with natukaka.😔💔\n\nNo wonder why value of this show is going down day by day.\nAnd they deserve this.\n(Feel sad to even say this😔 but they themselves are now ruining the reputation of this legendary show)\n\n9 out of 10 times they are celebrating festival 🥴😳🤬\nAnd running to one house to another house doing nothing.\n(I wonder how even actors agree to do this shit every single time),I already stopped watching Tmkoc regularly since 2020\nBut still sometimes I do check what is going on in current episode and everytime they are celebrating festivals.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 (They most shitty part is they celebrate one day festival for one-two weeks that cracks me up) 😭😭\nAnd doing shitty programs.
"Instead of decently showing he died and paying tribute to the character, Ashit brought a cheap replacement",Yeah man... They should have given tribute to him like how it was given to Paul Walker in f&s movie
A whole different chemistry between both of them,"Yes, Prime minister banne ka sapna pura karne gaya hai goli. Free me pizza burger baatna hai PM banke 😬"
![gif](giphy|DDsLbuZqw7ZLrvQmnV|downsized)\n\none of the best duos.,KAJAZ KI BANTI KBHI KASTI NI...\n\nGOLI BETA MASTI NAHI.
 uncle. One of the best duos,SMART LAG RAHE HO
Their chemistry and scenes always worked out so well,And were actually funny and not cringe mostly
There is going be a different level of heartbreak when the show itself gets over. I know the show has become unbearable and must end but still it will break my heart❤️‍🩹,Nahane ja nahane. Aur gandhi ji ki tarah bakri ka dhoodh pi. 🥰
Kya uncle smart lag rahe ho,Kitna kha rha hain Jhadiya 😏
Chalo kam se kam yahan post kiya  matlab asit se permission mil gayi hogi goli ko to leave . Dilip joshi had no guts when shailesh lodha left .,I've heard that Dilip Joshi and Shailesh Lodha didn't have a good relationship in real life.
My favourite Jethalal and Goli moment would be the one with the haircut on the roadside. \nThat was peak comedy for me.,*Kitna kha rha hai Jadiya* 😮‍💨
,Goli ka bhai capsule 😂
"Ashit Modi and writer could actually made the story as ""goli leaving golkuldham for further medical research"" but they just replace him with some newbie who don't resemble GOLI energy at all.",They will never end the Goli character because they want milk the same old jokes for many more times in future. Also they won’t introduce a new character because of their laziness in thinking of new jokes.
Match me ek moment tha bc ek ladki 100+ seconds tk camera frame me rhi. Mai awkward ho gya gharwalo k saamne bc,Literally natlab tum kitne chutiye ho skte ho bhai thodi to sharam krle tharki cameraman

I've never seen any society member eating non veg food.,I have never seen any show where they eat non veg in sab tv.
"The old tmkoc days was soooo damn fucking good in such layering of naughty jokes. This is that typical joke where the subtlety will only be received by the adults watching the show, where as the kids might not be able to catch on it. Smart writing..... Sadly has gone extinct since few years","So true, it was subtle but hits hard"
Puraane episodes me babita bhi jethalal ko line deti thi,Aur log us champak buddhe ki bezzati bhi karte the .
"When people say TMKOC was ahead of its time, it’s true. And now that clock has stopped 🫠",Its going in reverse
"'Bring me Thanos!'\n\n- Natu Kaka, probably",More like bring me my bonus seth ji

iss phase mein bapuji smajhdaar tha. ab toh buddha sathiya gya hai.,Show ke shuruat ke episodes mein bhi Buddha harami tha. Hamesha jetha ko sunata tha aur kosta tha.\n\nYe saala beech ke episodes mein hi theek tha

But madhavi said to daya “aapke ghar me dhan aati hai hamare ghar laxmi” 😠,"Madhvi ki maa ki, jethiya is goat"
Lekin jetha bhagyashali nahi hai jo iske jaisa baap mila :(,Chamfu*k Aaj b isko 10 saal k bacche k tarah daanta rehta hai. Tuchye ko samjhta h nahi k ye bada aadmi hai koi baccha nahi.

The creators could easily transition the show to next era where the kids are now married and take center stage. But as we A shit , they will wear half pant and do their rsgular tapu sena bakchodi","TMKOC feels like it was never supposed to have more episodes than 1000, it is though true that show peaked a lot(in both popularity and content) up till 2000 ep, then fell off."
its still not too late drop him back to his gaao\n\n![gif](giphy|s4VoCsFz8prlhSFCeS),or somewhere in between
Bahot hi ganda arc. Definitely not marrying each other but so much double meaning.,kya hua give me context mai ab ye show dekhna nhi chahta tv pe
"Can someone please explain to me the entire arc which is going on, I don't watch new episodes","Tappusena go to a party, tapu and sonu come late, bhindi master gets worried. The next day bhide ke relatives come to see them, wo batate hai ki unki beti ne love marriage kiya, this make bhide more worried. This same goes on with gada family, chumpuck is worried about tappu going to parties and coming late so both bhide and chumpuck decide to get sonu and tappu married."
Even though the show is boring i still have the habit of watching tmkoc while eating,Just watch the old episodes
I don't watch new episode.. What happened??,TLDR: Shadi ki Bakchodi\n\nTapu aur Sonu party me se late wapas aaye to Bhide aur Champak sochte hai abhi wo bahut irresponsible ho gye he so it's better to marry them off (not with each other). Aur wo dono apne apne cast me unke liye partner dhundh rahe hai lekin dono ko shadi nhi karni
Context??,"So Tapu & Sonu went to the party & they came very late. Both Bhide and Chapak realize that their children are out of control. \n\nBoth think of getting them married (not to each other as Bhide in his heart doesn't want to see Tapu as his son in law) \n\nNot when they talk to them separately of getting married, they resist. \nTapu says ""I want to become something before getting married. \n\nSonu says "" I also don't want to get married now"""
Bro knows the meme culture. What a legend,He IS MEME CULTURE
He’s actually very educated and culturally sound. Man listens to the best alternative rock bands of all time,He is definitely fun to hang around with judging from his interviews. He is cool with his music and movie tastes.
Tell me that this is not edited🤯🤯🙏🙏,Naa man he posted this on his Instagram!
So satisfying,***Hello mahila police station. Jethalal ne Popat ki Biwi todh di.***
Jethalal was trying to stay calm and avoiding any dispute but popatlal ko jyada charbi,But woh toh itna patla hai
The main reason for that is the presence of Madhvi😂,Would have had a more explosive reaction if Babeetaji had been there instead LOL.
Jethalal looked quite formidable in this scene with his unprecedented seriousness.,Abey kya angrezi maar raha hai
Next thing you know bro hangs the umbrella on his balcony for everyone to see haha what a attention wh*re 💀🤡,And after that chamfuck asks jetha to apologise
Episode no,Ep 455\nHappy Cake Day
But why jetha was sad?,"He has been trying to secure an order for 200 TVs from a hotel for the past six months. However, the hotel manager mentioned that there are better dealers, casting doubt on Jethalal's likelihood of obtaining the order. That is why he's sad. Although, he got the order afterwards."
I hate popatlal,That's a credit to Popatlal's acting skills.
Miss old TMKOC episodes!!,Sometimes I get emotional seeing how this show has deteriorated over the years
All this stupidity by popatlal and still jethalal gets schooled. FREAKING nuts,"Exactly. Later on, it is jethalal who apologises to popatlal for his behaviour."
"Not gonna lie, Jethalal tha isiliye bas chatha toota, mein hota toh USS popatiya ka muh Tod deta.",Nhi chatta sidha piche jake khulta dibbe ke
Is scene mein Jethalal aur Popatlal donon ne achchi acting ki hui hai. Ek ne udaas hone ki acting achchi ki toh doosre ne andar ka gussa chehre pe khoob dikhaya. Kitne achche actors hain! 👍,Agreed! Purane wale sabhi actors acchi acting krte the
Male ego,Jethiya ka ki popat ka?
How does Jetha handle both Bapuji and Daya 😭😭😭,mehta and babita is your answer👀 they help him cope
Shila dhaba ..sorry nashila dhaba😂,"Bapuji: Tum log kahin Nashila Dhaba to nahi gaye the? \n\n\nPopat: Chaacha ji aap wahaan jaate hain??! \n\n\nBapuji: Chup kar dibbe, maine kuch din pehle akhbaar mein padha tha, ""Nashila Dhaba mein machi Nashili bhagdad""\n\n\nChampak's expressions while narrating his dialogues are always top notch, and this whole story was filled with hilarious scenes."
And daya entering with a bucket of cold water~AHHA 🤌,No one wife should be as dumb and as careless as Data
Nah little bit overacting there,Sometimes a little bit of overacting creates more laughter than normal
Final mission kill aSHIT Modi,and reclaim the Modi Mansion
You should’ve chosen the image from when daya comes to save jethalal from the kidnappers as well,Will add it in Trailer 2
This probably took more hours to edit than the last 1000 episodes of TMKOC,Took me 4 hours to make this

Masterpiece.\n\nBtw which program did you use to edit the text reveal at last?,i used after effects for the text and most of the editing was done on premiere pro
I think we will get GTA 6 before Daya comes back,then we all will be like WE GOT GTA 6 BEFORE DAYA COMES BACK!!!
Never gonna release,more like we won't be alive till then
"Woh ""look who's back"" pe bucket ke andar girne wala drop, mazedaar 😂😂😂😂\n\nVery well done.",i laughed at that moment for 5 minutes straight when i was editing that scene and replaying it😂😂
This is the best edit I've ever seen💀,😌abhi toh aur bhi baaki hai😌
Jetha performed better than Iyer lol,That's what Babitaji said
Gun nakli hai but nafrat asli h,Nafrat banti bhi hai

"Also the \n\n""Doston, aaj main sunane ja rha hu ek ,Babita""",One liners to humare zamane ke tmkoc ke hua karte the
Bro this afternoon I was searching for this clip on yt as 'tmkoc bapujitaji scene' and you uploaded this☠️ internet is scary place,Bro I was trying to buy embarrassed terror on dark net but it wasnt available.  And now I seee u . it sure is scary 💀
"Whenever I see the old episodes, mann karta hai AShit Modi ko ek zorr ka thapad lagau. Woh bhi kaan ke neeche, mast ek thapad.\nKya show tha yeh pehle, abhi kya kachara bana diya hai.",Yes mudi sud rejine
It's airing on tv guys.... Watch it,Even YouTube Is recommending same 😂
Babita ji Babita ji 🕺\n\nBabita ji Babita ji 🕺,Subha 4 baje bhi chand jaise dikti hai baaa..
Babita ji aaj mai apne dil ki baat boling 😂,"When I realise that it's been 11 years since I was watching this show, and still I've never heard of this arc 😳😬"
"Jethalal is like the second most loyal guy. He only likes babita ji. It's not like he is looking for a woman everywhere, even in a crowd full of models he would only look for babitaji. Plus, he has a healthy and happy marriage. Shows how much he cares.",Who is the most loyal then
It's like me when I visited my friend only to see her mom.,Better marry the friend. So whenever you take your wife to her house you'll hit 2 birds in one stone\n\n1.) You get to see her mom whenever you want .\n\n2.) Your wife will be happier as you care about her family more than her and won't even doubt about you having interest in any other person.
"When Taarak cracks lame jokes, society waale:- 🤣🤣🤣\n\nWhen Bhide cracks lame jokes, society waale:- 😡😡\n\nDouble Standards.",Bhide's jokes are funny unlike others.
I really like his jokes but koi society member nahi hasta😂😂🤣🤣,Wohii toh ache puns hote h ngl😂😂
"Bhai ye episode konsa hai, kabhi dekha nahi maine","Episode 501, straight from the vault. ✨"
Aise character har society mein hone chahiye,Bhai Teri profile pic dekh ke maj pdhle bsdk bolne waala tha ...
Jetha defending bhide is a sight to behold,Jetha doesn't care about bhide. He just want to annihilate iyer at any point. His second target is bhide only.
"Iyer is savage. ngl I feel bad for him when Jethalal targets him because he is the husband of babita. I am all for Jethalal, but Jethalal - babita arc is immoral despite it being funny  to me due to its representation. Even after that it seems overdone sometimes","Be it a bad representation or not, be it immoral or not, I take a show as a show and not as real life. And it is a fact that when babita jethalal flirting was on absolutely fire mode in the older episodes (first 500 to 1000) the show was actually worth watching and people enjoyed the show to its fullest! And afterwards when the show makers actually tuned down the flirting and eventually almost removed it in later episodes, tmkoc actually became boring and lifeless."
Iyer ko kya hi pta ...babita roj upar Wale floor kyu jati hai,You mean Popatlal Babita ki duniya hila deta hai?

Dekho dekho yeh uncle ko society function chhod ke office jate hai .... Kyun friends... Haa 🤣,Sahi kaha tapu\n\n-- lord pinku
Decorating each other's ass lmao 😂,Now I can't unimagine it 💀
When the show started Iyer and many other artists were of the same age as the tapu sena currently is. Which shows how badly they have ignored aging and showed the least character development.,Ashit be like: What is character development? 💀
"""chalo friends cricket khelte hai,yeh hi hamari Umar khelne ki 40 saal tak to ham adult nahi ban rehe""",Bc 10 saal se college me pde hue h
"It really gets annoying where, after every week they do some shit show. And ask Bhindi for money. If my father had a shop like Jethalal, I would give rest to my father and start going to shop myself. Literally, wtf are they doing all day just "" chalo frenz cirkat khelte hai"" ""frenz chalo garden mai aam toodte hai""   ""frenz chalo kuch backchodi karte hai""\nLike bro wtf are they doing with their life. Bhindi master once said ""Tappu ke baap ki dukaan hai, tum logon ke baap ke paas nahi"" we hated him at that time, but it hits today seeing where the show has gone.","Earlier, when they used to do some show in society from arc's starting to end it was fun to watch. Now it's all about prizes. Even I get confused sometimes that is this a sitcom or a reality TV show."
"Imagine you a 26 yo good earning IT employee starts living on rent in gokuldham. And Sonu starts getting attached to you and leaves tapu sena. Also, you constantly bring your colleagues including female colleagues to your flat.","Sabse pehle Bhide, Tappu aur Popat, ye teeno ki duniya badal jayegi"
dheere dheere sab show chhod denge and then we'll have TMKOC with a whole new cast.\n\n\nThe show makers have already started ruining it...\nI miss the old vibes. 😮‍💨,Sab show chhod denge lekin Pinku nhi chhodega
"Glad she resigned from the Tapu Sena first, that proves the intelligent part.","🤣🤣🤣 you made my day, wit 📈"
The best Sonu!! And so happy for her.. they look great together! 🤍,"You know what made her a Classy Lady, when she thanked her ex boyfriend for leaving her. If he hadn't left her she wouldn't have found her man. Breakup is beautiful it makes you wise, develop your character and next time you find someone better because you have worked on yourself."
"She was the perfect Sonu for that role and that time, especially when Bhide wasn't financially strong. She portrayed an innocent girl who had her own desires, which is natural for a young child. However, understanding her family's situation, she remained content and satisfied. Considering her strict father, she didn't speak much either and found happiness in what she had.",True and for that credit goes to the writer :) loved how the show was written...so real...so genuine...so Mumbaiyaaa :)
This officer also registered my marriage a few months back lol,"Congratulations brother, advice :- Beta buaa toh naam Tapu or beti Hui toh Sonu"
u/DramaticRise9249 do you know the song playing in the background?,Yes 😍It's With you- AP Dhillon
Inter faithmarriage?,Haha....nopes.....every marriage needs to be registered .....be it arranged/love/interfaith/ within their own community whatsoever
"This show is so inaccurate, a tution teacher/Coaching teacher, if experienced, earns in lakhs. There's no way Bhide could be poor, specially the way he has been potrayed-  a well established teacher..",I guess they have shown that Bhide charges less than the usual tution rates.
4 lakhs for that car is actually very reasonable🤔,In 2011 ?. Just curious
which episode is this,Upper one is 31\nAnd lower one is 4213
And that with underarm bowling 💩,"Bacche hai bhai lagg jaye ga unhe , unke best batsman tapu ko underarm main six bhi tho marna hai"
I won't be surprised if GKM 2 happens in the next few years,Just a guess but that could be the next big arc during ipl season
"Inki 10th tb hui thi jb mein 6th mein tha, ab mai 2 saal graduation khatam krke job kr rha hu",Aap ke bache bhi job krne lagenge par yeh tabh bhi cricket khelenge woh bhi underarm bowling k sath
Wo malaiya bhi kaam lag gaya hoga pakka,Majdoor logo ka sardar
"Even tho I am not watching the new episodes but still just by looking at the picture I can say that tapu sena has become the cringiest part of tmkoc now.. like whenever I come across any clip of new episode here on this sub or on some insta page, can give it a shot for one minute but inki toh picture hi dekh ke gussa aata hai 😭🤡",Ye episode 2017 ka hai
That's fine....25 years old people play cricket.... \n\nBut underarm bowling kaun karta he😝,"Welcome to Mumbai, we don't have space to play overarm. Forget under arm, most of cricket is played as ""box cricket""."
Dhoni 43 saal ki age me bhi toh khel raha hai,7 upvotes thala for a reason
Mere idhar toh 33 saal ke berozgaar 15-20 waalon ke saath khelte hai,Underarm bowling k sath 🤣🤣
Tarak Anjali & Babita Iyer \n\nNo kids policy ki wajah se team badi ho hi nahi rahi hai,"Gokuldham society hi population ka dhyan rakh Rahi hai . Sab ke ek hai Bache, aur 2 couple k toh hai hi nahi."
bhai inki boards ke wakt main 2nd mein tha ab mera 11 finals bhi dediya,"Inhone kya padha kab padha kyun padha kuch nahi pata. Achanak se tappu ek din aakar bolta hai mera mba hogaya , goli bolta hai mbbs hogaya, gogi se to kuch umeed nahi hai, sonu ne arts leke kya kiya. Naukri bhi nahi karte ."
What is the problem in playing at 25? Cricket is a lifetime hobby. Playing Underarm is laughable though.,Well it's nothing wrong though dude they are still in college since few years and they do nothing but acts childish and society members called them bachhe
Arey Band kar! Band Kar!!,Arey taqat laga. Kholll
aisa scene sochke usko banane wala kaam aaj kal kyu nhi krte pata nahi,Haa naa.... Writers were soo crazy back then
"The way Daya says tapu ke papa when jethalal tries to protect champak always kills me, hilarious af",🤣🤣 right? As if he's going to die taking a bullet on him
Hamesha socha tha ki ye scene sach mein ek hi take mein le liya tha makers ne ya ni..agar ek take mein okay hua toh pata ni kaise hua..,"I think they must have done a bit of rehearsal.... You can see at the start ,the ground is already wet..."
Jethalal disguised as thug using different languages to stop bhide to get Sonu back...,What episode is this?
Totally agree. Which episode number was this?,Epi 387..whole episode is epic XD
"Why did not he move away, is he stupid?",Bhai y Einstein wala dimag bahar chhod do plz comedy dekhte samay\n\nScientifically/politically correct script sochne Lage to hogyi comedy

"Madhvi delivering achar papad in Pune while bhide lecturing someone about sistachar, poor woman 😔",ye konsa achar hai sista wala
"She is looking so good here. Nowadays in TMKOC, they dress her like a cartoon. SMH",I think the main problem is her hairstyle in the new ep
"Kya baat!!!! Seriously,…one of the best character in Mahila Mandal, if not the whole TMKOC. Genuinely wish she had a more progressive and extravagant husband.",Yes she's the best character amongst all the MM. I'm glad she's the first actor from TMKOC that I met.
Madhu sirf Saadi pehna karti thi...tu bohot change ho gayeli hai re madhu,"Lol, but actually speaking all these actors on-screen talk in high pitch but in real life they are extremely soft spoken"
that’s cool bro!! kuthlya area madhe bhetli?? i hope i bump into jethya or atmya one day 😬,"Bhide actually made a colab with Atharva Sudame ig during last year Ganpati. Shanwarat bhetle hote, mahiti asta tar prayatna kela asta bhetnyacha (He's my Fav, more than or equal to Jetha)"
"OMG, that's very lucky you Op \n\n\n\nHow is her behaviour with fans ?","She was casually walking with another lady (possibly a friend or relative) & was very soft spoken when I approached her. Despite being in hurry & agreed to click a photo with me. \n\n>OMG, that's very lucky you Op\n\nExactly!!! There were so many variables that would've lead to me not being there at the exact moment, yet I'm glad I was lucky enough to meet her"
Where in Pune was this? I won’t be able to recognise her without makeup.,I knew how she looked irl because I've watched few of their interviews. But at first even I wasn't sure
Can we stop calling celebrities as ma'am and sir! Normalise calling them by their names,Idk but in this case it seems totally okay to say sir and ma'am. OP is probably much younger than Madhvi and Bhide and can address them politely
"can she walk on pune road, minding her own business like normal people?  \nwont people bug her every 10-20 steps...?\n\ni assumed tv actors cant just randomly do their thing like us....","I was shocked as well, she was walking with another lady so casually & nobody seemed to notice her. I too was shocked & confirm atleast 3-4 times in my mind that is she really who I think she is before approaching"
Bhai ye toh modern clg ke pass ka area hai right?,Almost. Ardha km dur hai par ha. Goodluck Cafe se 100m dur hai ye area
She was????\nDid she also leave?,Arrey bhai woh log roj roj thodi shoot pe jaate hai
U should have given her the advice of maintenance of her finance..... otherwise sbka haal roshan and roshan jaisa hojaega...with debts of lakhs,She was in a hurry & who am I to give her finance advice (I have a degree in it) but that'd be so weird for a random stranger to tell her that. We feel that we know the actors because we constantly see them on-screen but for them were just another random guy who they make happy just by saying something & letting them click photos
"After that day, Tapu started giving drugs to Pinku because he couldn't digest Pinku as a better cricketer than him. Pinku has been drugged so much that, due to side effects, he can only say ""ha tapu"". India lost a fast bowler due to the greed of an underarm cricketer. Just imagine Bumrah from one end and Pinku from the other end.",This needs to be the top comment😭
bcci destroyed his career 😔😔,"I only believe in pinku bhai, game changer player he is"
Aisa jhaatu helmet kaun pehenta hai bhai?!,"Wohi tho, ye helmets ka istamaal 30 years se band hain"
Haven’t seen the ep but I can already imagine the hriday parivartan they did on Pinku to dumb down his bowling lol,"It was a dream for a really brief moment, Daya imagined that Tapu might get hurt if they allow them to play eity leather ball."
Happy for her😁,Popatlal ki bhavishya vaani shi hui. Sonu ki shaadi hogyi.
Why did she leave the show?,she had exams and wanted to later focus on her studies than the show
Why do these couples of the day hold hands together and raise it in the air  when they can just raise their ring fingers and ask the attendees to acknowledge them like The Bloodline do.\n\nThe groom can call himself the Tribal Chief and the bride can call herself whatever she likes.,"Pandit ji speaking - the most violent the most diabolical the beast slayer, instead of ajeem o shan shehenshah song 😂"

"ek epiosde mein aise hi kitchen wale scene mein khidki pe bahar gokuldham society dikhai deti hai, asli wali",The entire building is illogical.
Aaj tak inke gharon ki rooms ka orientation samjh nahi aaya. Inka kitchen aur bathroom dono combined hai.,Bathroom se kitchen jati hai daya 😂😂
Was the door to the Kitchen ever shown or is it like The Room Of Requirement from Harry Potter whose door is only revealed when someone wants it to?,"Nope, it was never shown.Builder ne shayad bathroom se secret door banwaya tha kitchen me jane ke liye 😂😂"
I was not convinced at first that she was best suited to be popat's wife but after re-watch I like the idea It was 9-10 years ago Popat was desperate but didn't looked like creepy grandpa also Actress was pretty and good at acting; It would been better  if they had Baldev's inclusion instead of that Annoying Bawri's parents; Honestly there was no need to make  Bawri regular,She had the perfect looks for a guy like popat to pull
Rome wasn't built in a day\n\nNeither is my hate for Ashit Modi,It was for me
at that i was convinced they just can't afford to hire another permanent cast. gave up entirely.,And the next storyline is Bawari - a completely new addition
White should be Dr. Hathi,Nope. He also has little evil in him. Remember the statue game episode. He ate mehta's tirangi barfi by making him statue.
100% agreed. For all white one Abdul might make more sense tho.,"I was also about to give that spot to Abdul at first, then I remembered his early days"
How is Daya evil? I think she should be just kindness,Supporting sundar isn't anything kind \n\nAssuming that they used to make it obvious at the start of the show that daya knew about it \n\nAnd also seeing a few theories about jethalaal and dayas whole marriage being a scam setup by them brother and sisters\n\nAnd most importantly she left her family for like 6-7 years now

Top 10 moments when actors weren't acting💀,The Judges are over acting
"Bharti knows how to give it back to creeps in a funny yet sarcastic way, she did it with Udit Narayan too, when he rubbed her back in a weird way.",That's good. All women should do the same. They do it because they keep getting away with it. As soon as they start getting called out. They will stop.
Ye bkl sach me bhi lagta hai ki ye ladkiyo ko chedta hoga,Sach me hee toh cheda hai na usne
Look at the reaction of ashit when tarak mehta was talking about him,Yeah he looks uncomfortable af. I think this whole exchange made him nervous.
What’s episode of what show is this ?,"It's India's got  latent, sorry sorry it's india's got talent😇"
Why does asit laugh later after everyone? He looks weird af.,Pretending to be a nice guy
Judges off camera - 😐\n\n\nJudges on camera - 😂🤣😝,All celebrities in a nutshell *
As usual champak being a total jackass,Nah... He scolded daya for this. That was the first time I saw he actually scold her.
Can imagine what Jethiya ki baa looked like.,Vo sayad daya jesi slim hogi
Kudos to the music department too. The BGM is absolutely bang on.,Music ke bina show ka maja aadha ho jata h old episodes me
I was just thinking does nobody ring Bell or knock on door before entering gada's home? 😂\nAise hee similar situations kitni baar aaya hai 😂,Times were simpler and happy when no one used to over analyse something and ruin it’s charm.
Ab saadi pehna usme ye ChamFuc* itna overreact kyu kar Raha hai 🤷🏻‍♂️,Kyoki vo dar ke sofe pe gir gaya or use gussa aa gaya
Wtf is going on with those background noises? Is someone having sex on the soundboard?,"ah, so im not the only westener absolutely confused"
"How have I, in all these years of watching TMKOC, never watched this scene?",Haww that's a shame 😂 Jetha here looked too cute to ignore 🥺
Bhide is the kind of dude who will say no to a free sample because he will think that he will be then obliged to buy the product now.,And popatlal will keep on asking for free sample until they declined and then fight them over how they can refuse free sample
"""Lekin bat paiso ki hi he 😂""",This Haathi was a vibe.
but madhvi toh gayi thi wtf,Phele ke episode main Bhide bohot kanjoos tha.
"Has never seen someone like bhide , such a Chu character",>such a Chu character\n\nThis sounds so funny
Sometimes I think she deliberately did that...😄,Haan Bhai script milti hai inhe.. sab intensional hi hota hai
Man I was looking for this exact clip but I forgot the ep. Thanks man,Welcome 😁 ep 1065
"This adds weight to the dark depression theory of Daya, in which her mother is actually dead (on this sub a few days ago).",Yeah even I saw that post. Did not read it fully tho
The old days when this show had comedy but now it's all about preaching gyaan,Not even gyann just fillers fr
Their combination is awesome. Missing their pair.,We all do bro😢
"As per 'Salaar', the fictional city of Khansaar is between Kachh & Sindh. So Jetha would've done a dunki towards Khansaar.\n\nJetha predicted Salaar VS Dunki way before💀.",Thala for a reason
Tmkoc is inspiration of every movie saare log isme se hi script uthate hai,Bruh even show ke writers khud. Itna iinspire hote hai storyline scene to scene rerun karte every 2 year the characters grow.
Jetha also did animal before Bollywood,"""Chup hoga sat me fail"" - chad jethalal\nVs ""sunai de raha hai behtar nahi hu mai "" -virgin ranvijay."
"Trust me, Bhavya is the most sensible actor in whole Tmkoc history as he knew that now it's time to leave.",Ok. But he hasn't been noticed since he left unfortunately.
I loved him as tappu and what he’s saying makes so much sense… fuck ashit,"seriously, he sounds so mature and balanced."
And they're still stuck as kids,"thats the worst plot , \n\n  \nthey have potential man , ashit can just show their career angle , he dont have brain"
Now it's high time that Dilip Joshi should also leave the show then only ashit has to wrap up the show with no other options left.,"woh nahi chorega , usko ek episode ke 1-2 lakh milte hai , maybe more ,"
So it’s that hard for them to come up with unique stories rather than the same plot reiterated for the 89th time. If i were one of the current writers of tmkoc I would avoid listing it on my resume when applying elsewhere,>If i were one of the current writers of tmkoc I would avoid listing it on my resume\n\nThousands of languages in the world and you chose to  speak facts
Bc tappu sena se hi episodes likhwa lete toh aaj bhi sahi chal rha hota.. but ye Ashit 💩,"Are sirf jo Taarak mehta ki original books hai uski stories ko bhi follow karte to bhi kafi new content mil jaata par...fir ye show Asit Modi ke ""Sankar"" ""pariwar"" or ""political mouthpice"" nahi ban sakte na"
"This is ""THE ONLY TAPPU"" I know,after his release my mind just couldn't comprehend the latter actors fitting for his character's role.\nBhavya is,and will be the only Tappu for most of us if I can comment on behalf of the spectators who used to love TMKOC.",Exactly we have seen from school going kiddo to college everything he is the OG🙌🙌
"So they would take 2-3 years to integrate a simple idea... Serials finish entirely in the timespan they are taking to ""take into consideration"". Maybe there's some banger idea they have considered for 2036, so stay tuned.","How can you have space for character development of kids when you have to have 1 Ganesh chaturthi arc, 2 popat marriage arcs, a holi arc etc every year"
Jb tak ye tapu tha tab tak hi maza aata tha dekhne ka 🚶🏻‍♀️,Nahi bro even Raj anadkat( 2nd tappu was good till his time but unhone fir story line hi chutiyapa jaisi banane Lage) ..
"Left this show at the perfect time. Kyuki zindagi bhar wohi role karta to zyada dusre roles ki opportunities nai milti. Roshan & roshan ko dekhlo koi kaam nai milra\n\nThis tapu left & tab se kaafi movies ki hai. Aur abhi to ek hindi movie bhi aari hai\n\nSonu(nidhi) also. Recently webs series kiya jiska rating acha hai.\n\nWo dusra tapu jo tha wo bhi acha actor tha. Wo bhi abhi ek gujarati serial me lead hero hai.\n\nIsiliye koi show nai chhod rahe. Dusre koi role he nai milenge. 3-4 log he hai jinko milega. Popatlal, iyer, bhindi & jetha. Wo naya taarak bhi kyuki wo already kaafi shows me kaam kar chuka hai.",Ha thik he Lekin dusri Kya opportunity mili?
Literally how all auctions work and champuck was offended in this too,Literally I used to be so annoyed at that old phuck
Yeh jethalal ka cheque hai bina sign kiye bhi pass ho jaye ga 😭😭,Jivesh bhai bank manager hai 🎶🎶
From not giving maintenance on time to giving 1 year advance maintenance seems like jetha grew his business,He was just lazy to give maintenance on time
Peace loving Bapuji on odd days,that ahinsha crap is not applicable when it comes to you ☠️💀
Back from when the show was absolutely hilarious. My 3rd fav scene from the show after ‘water tanker on bapuji’ and ‘jethalal getting electric shock in Goli’s presence’,Ayeee band kar!!!! Band kar!!! Band karr!!!
I am asking episode no. \n\nWill society accept me?,ep 366  \nyou're one of us
Magar Bhide galat kya bola.,Uske khandan ke bare me bolna galat nahi h?
Even in his own dream bhide can't compete with Gada family 😂,Gada family is uneducated and Bhide is absolutely right here.
Typical Marathi,We are way more dangerous and brutal than this🤣🤣
"Hi, came here through scrolling on Popular. I can't tell if this is a soap opera, comedy, or both.\n\nI'd also kill for subtitles.","The bald guy is insulting Jethalal (the guy with a small moustache), his son & his Father by calling them Illiterate because his son is always creating nuisance at the society they live. He then proceeds to call his whole family illiterate.\n\nHis son finally had it enough & shuts him down by saying ""Hey Bhindi, shutup"". \n\nBhindi is a Hindi word for Okra & the bald guy who is insulting is named ""Bhide"". So he's basically calling him a vegetable in a derogatory way. \n\nPS : This is a comedy show from India called Tarak Mehta ka Ooltah Chashma (tmkoc), it's available on YouTube, with some episodes having English Captions."
That was so disrespectful on Tappu's part. I know it's a dream but still.,"Not really , bhide poore khandaan ko anpadh gawaar bol raha tha ."

Is baar Abdul apna maksat Pura karega.,Alternate ending of TMKOC
Next storyline : \n1) Abdul's friend will try to convince abdul that his so-called family members are using him. He does all the work for them but still they insult him & treat him like a servant. \n\n2) His friend will offer him a partnership for new business. \n\n3) Abdul will ignore it first but will soon realize that his friend was correct. \n\n4) Society members will come to know about this. \n\n5) Abdul who is now left will miss goouldham. \n\n6) chamfuk chacha and tapu sena will try to convince Abdul by giving him lots of useless gyan. But at same time will realize they how important was Abdul to the society. \n\n7) Finally they will prove that they are his family (which they are not). His friend will also realize the true meaning of family. He will apologize Gokuldham. \n\n8) Over. One more time chamfuk Gyan and 18th century ethics will win over logic.,Gokuldham is the Hotel California which you can enter anytime but you can never leave.

"Tapu Sena has become really irritating in these new episodes of tmkoc we haven't seen a proper backstory of Pinku apart from his parents' story, Gogi is only for cracking silly jokes,Goli only eats in these new episodes.

Gulabo arc sabse lamba tha kya,"If talking bout under 1500, then yes longest, around a month long."
122-125 is about sundar's friends chhagan-magan to whom sundar told Jethalal to give money and there begins chaos because Jethalal mistaken both with each other as they have similar names which put him in trouble\n\nEdit: Vinay Pathak appearance as well\n\nPS: started watching tmkoc from epi-1 and currently on this arc itself,Yeah I forgot to add that in Guide lol

Iyer ne acting mai bhi babita ko cheat nahi kiya he was uncomfortable touching her . On the other hand we have babita jo jetha ji jetha ji karke usse hug bhi kar leti hai.,"Car wale episode me jab babita jethalal ko hug karti hai vo bahut ajeeb laga mujhe to, jethalal bapuji ke sanskar bhool gya tha"
Babita Iyer ko pyaar nahin karta.,Bhai iyer ko ek bar hug tak nahi kara tha sach malum chalne ke bad bhi
the cuck chairs in hotels are there for iyer idli. no hate though 😌,Dude I had to Google the meaning of cuck chairs to understand your comment.
Can someone tell what this arc was about,"Iyer thought that Babita didn't love him because he overheard a conversation she had with a friend over the phone where she told the other woman how she was compromising in her relationship with Iyer, he quickly jumped to the conclusion that whatever he heard was actually true, but in fact, Babita said all those things to her friend so that she stopped comparing her relationship with others, he was devastated cause he didn't know the truth and decided to indirectly convince Babita to divorce him by pretending to have an affair."
"Munmun Datta aka Babita Ji don’t like touch from a dark skinned man. She had gotten this as a pact that she won’t do any romantic/husband wife closeness scenes like other members do. \n\nIn one arc when Bakka Palty touched her to put colors on her cheeks, she had a huge debate over that.",Seems so ironic to me considering her father was a dark skinned man too.

Imagine if K.D Pathak from adalat was Jetha's lawyer 💀\n\n,Imagine if Jethalal brought Saul goodman. 💀

Why's Bhide so THICC,Khathe peethe garka hai
Jetha ne Iyer ko aise 1000 baar treat kiya hai. Well deserved tha,I don’t know about new episodes par old episodes mai toh Jetha Bhide or Iyer se aise bast karta tha jaise kutto ko bhaga raha ho gusse se. Comedy mai bhi itna jahil panna funny nahi lagta (Sab ke samne dono par chills deta tha or unki baat katta rahta tha). \n\nReality mai toh yeh bhot maar Khata jagah jagah se
"Kyu karre iyer introduction, uska mazak banata hai jethalal uski patni ko pervert ki tarah ghoorta hai . Friend manta kaha tha jethalal iyer ko sirf babita k piche pada rehta hai. Kabhi scientist wali izzat mili bhi usko ki woh anpad jethalal ka introduction kare","Toh Iyer ki itni phatti kyu hai? Sidha sidha kyu nahi bolta jethalal ko? 🤡\n\nIyer ko bekar mai hi saare sympathy dete rahte hai, agar usse pata hai ki jetha babita pe line Marta hai or babita bhi kuch nahi kahati toh woh kyu nahi bolta? Jitni galti isme jetha ki Nikal rahe ho usse kayi zada galti babita or Iyer ki hai."
"Iyer ne Taarak ko apna best friend bola par Taarak ne kabhi Iyer ki friendship ki koi kadr nahin ki, ulta Taarak Jethalal ki Babita ko line maarne mai help aur karta hai.","Ha , apne friend ko samjhata nahi ki babita k sath flirt mat kar kisi ki wife hai"
Rare friendships 💯,Tarak also all in one.

"She realised Jethalal ki harkatein with Babita ji. 😏\nAnd all this time Sundar was conspiring along with them, taking Taxi ka bhada🫢, where he actually used to commute by Train.","Both of them doesn't deserve each other\n\nJethalal for being disloyal\n\nDaya for supporting her harami brother and doing a lot of silly mistakes too (she comes from a poor family, whereas Jethiya has made it to millions)"
"Hmm, yes, it does make sense. She never let Jethalal and her mother (lover) talk over the phone.",No it's just that Jetha doesn't like talking to Daya's Mother as she makes his weird names
It can be but sometimes jethalal had talked to her mother (very few times),Even Champak talked to her once.
"in addition, dayaben is now happily living with her bf in Ahmedabad.",And getting money from jetha
That pic of old tapu and hathi bhai is so cute,I miss our old hathi :(
they look like a joint family 🧡,Jab ye sab actors the tab gokuldham ek parivaar tha ab to bus chutiya hai.

"Whenever this part used to come on tv, i used to run away to other room and get back when the scene changes.\n\nThat getting locked in laboratory, guard busy with his wife on the phone and not receiving iyers call, rickshaw, police, everything was just so frustrating.\n\nDisneyland hong kong arc will be one of my favs <3",omg are we the same ppl. even I used to do that
Iyer did not go with them.. Because he wanted to take care of her unwell mother. \n\nThat's what I read somewhere few years back.. Not sure about the authenticity of the source.,Iyer didn't go to Singapore as well...maybe passport issues
Vo Asit hi bhi gya par iyer ko leke nahi gaya bkl,IRL Iyer is not married.. and Iyer did not go with them.. Because he wanted to take care of her unwell mother.
Iyer had bought his own tickets so why didn't he take the next flight?,Because jethalal had everyone's tickets
Not only this there are n number of scenes which clearly resemble that the makers hate southies especially tamilians. Especially that FatFuck jethiya.,Iyer's character was very offensive in the early episodes. His entire gimmick was that of a dark skinned socially awkward nerd who doesn’t deserve his pretty wife.
"It seems like Babita doesn't care about Iyer at all. I mean, who goes to Disneyland without their husband? And just because Jethalal convinced her, she agreed to go?","Jethalal never convinced her, It was iyer who convienced her saying ye tumhara bachpan ka sapna tha disneyland jaaneka and hum wapas sath jayenge etc."
"This and bhootni arc was so peak. TMKOC was all set to redefine the television space but within a few years, all fell apart.",No no let's assume post renovation everything is not canon... The legacy of og TMKOC still stands strong... What we are seeing now is anyway a ship of theisius so doesn't matter... Og TMKOC ended back then
This arc was really amazing 😭😭😭Also the ending bro jetha calling babita devi 😭😭and that whole conversation also bhide saying jethanand ji prani nahi pakshi😭😭😭,Jethalal saying Yamli pagli diwani to jwala😭😭😭
This arc was stretched a lot yeah but man the comedy in it was just too good,Yeah. That's the only downside. But still a pretty much watchable arc.
'Lady Gaga' 😂,us samay to mujhe pata bhi nahi tha koi lady gaga bhi hai
"You missed that fafda , jalebi and gathiya part of hathi bhai",Came here to comment this
i watch this almost 3-4 times a week.,Kyon samajh nahi aaya ab tak?
When I was young I use to find it funny when now when I re-watch old episodes I realise how toxic is his family. It still funny though no doubt about it but I feel for jethyaa.,I mean it's not real..
***This*** ***Scene*** ***Will*** ***Never*** ***Happen*** ***In*** ***Modern***-***Day*** **TMKOC**.,Not even 1% of this level.
Bhide was really beefing with a 10 year old 😂,"vo log bhindi(veg)  ki baat kar rahe hain, na ki beef (non veg) ki baat kar rahe hain"
How did i miss this. What's the episode number,"How can you say that , this is one of the most iconic scenes of tmkoc"
Humare zamane me...........,आपके ज़माने में भी भिंडी मिलती थी
"If they made this today, they would have made tapu sonu as couple here instead of goli sonu….","And bhide would say ""beti ki pita ka chinta tum nahi janti madhvi"" or some shit"
The only time Tappu Sena made us emotional,Tapu did it twice tho...one more during haircut episode
From this to making stupid jingles. What a tragedy.,Whole show is tragedy now
the most dialogues lord pinku ever got,I was searching for this comment lol
Principal was too cringe mujhe 33000 chaiye kaise bhi 🙃,That was rational tbh.
Gulab Kumar hathi overshadowed everyone in this arc.,When has he never ? Goli is the best character in tapu sena except for prime tappu sometimes and the second sonu. He has a personality and has nice interactions with the rest of the cast.
"They were and then they had to ruin this arc by making Tapu give away all the money without any verification. They made a good skit, gave a good message, but no they had to do more.",That's how a kid's mind works though.
"This arc showed their true acting range, which got wasted further down the line",what is full form of arc
Yeah but didnt they give the money to some fraud people .,no they were genuine people
During this episode I cried so hard my eyes hurt 🥺,"Happy cake day, you have completed 1 year"
Agree and then donated the collected money to roadside scammers. Principal ki to alag se G jal gayi thi,"Shayad tune pura arc dekha nahi, wo log genuine the"
Iyer showed Champak his place was the best thing he did,fr he needs this treatment from every1
"This was such a stupid arc. As partners, the most important thing is to have mutual understanding, not this ""selfless"" behavior of becoming the villain so no one will talk bad about the other person. When Iyer heard Babita talk shit about him (she was lying to her friend, which is another stupid plot point), Iyer should've gone home and talked to Babita about her feelings. Even if what she had said was true, maybe she doesn't want a divorce.",Sahi me bhai. Agar tumhare koi Toxic friend tumse openly jealous hai to usse avoid karo ! Ye kya baat hua ki apne hi nakli dukh batane lage.\n\nAur ye sayanist bhi direct Devdas ban gya. Ek baar discuss to kar leta.
#Iyer is average reddit user,Aap bich me dakhal mat dijiye
I love Iyer and babita acting in this arc shows how much potential they have as actors and writers and Ashit is wasting such talent,"Ikr, Iyer and Babita are just made into bashing and flirting props for Jethalal."
which arc tho ?,"Iyer-Babita divorce arc (new one, not the old)"
Hua kya tha waise iss ep mein..brief mein batayega koi.?,Bhai basically iyer sunleta h ki babita don't love her and then he pretends to be a cheater so babita Divorce and get free but there are too many misunderstandings in the arc u should check out probably last good arc for me it does not have many funny scenes but dramatically it is good
Koi explain karega ya ep no / name bata do ?,Iyer-Babita divorce arc. I have explained it in the comments above.
Society decorate karne ke liye laakho ₹ hai chindi reasons ke liye BUT Abdul ko genuine reason ke liye ₹5 Dene mai maut aa gai thi.,"The worst part was when they organised the Gola vendor to do Gola party but didn’t invite Abdul to share the gola with them.  \nWhere I live, we invite our sweepers and watchmen along with their entire families, when we organise some party or something like that !"

Oo bhai 👀. \nYeh toh kabhi socha hi nahi. Still babita loves jethalal more than Iyer Idli.,Exactly .She openly flirts with him
Maybe that's what babita ji find cute about jethalal....,Underwear with holes easier to get Jethya's fafda out.
or Jetha has humiliation kink,Or babita is a kuk
But the thing is why she is not leaving Jethalal if she already knew,Maybe because she knows he won't do anything about the crush

Usko potray hi aise krte hai jaise wo hi villain h,"If you really think about it, Jethalal would be the meanest person if he was in his character, he always makes fun of Iyer for being south Indian, he doesn't appreciate Daya and always blames on others"
"As kids, you love Jethalal, but as you get mature, you realise Iyer is actually the real Hero.\n\nLots of love and hugs Iyer Bhai🫂",As a kid you find logic in this but as you get mature you realise that it's just a sitcom and purely made for entertainment and move on without complaining or whining about every illogical thing .
Imagine role reversal. Iyyer flirting with daya. The show would get cancelled\n\nPeople always have a bias towards main character and hate black people in general.His real life is sad too if you know,"Also, because Babita is portrayed as a modern woman it is ok to flirt with her, but nobody should flirt with sanskaari daya. It is the “what was she wearing? Must’ve been her fault” mentality."
"His character is made to be boring and uninteresting, it has nothing to do with him protecting Babita","he was also a bit of an elitist, made uneducated comments about jetha all the time"
People love pervert jethalal,he is asshle  ugly bastard
"It's not about that. I hate him because he's always mean to jethalal because he's jealous not because he is protecting her. If he has a problem with his wife talking to jethalal then he should talk it out with Babita, change the location etc. But being in the same place mentally is not good for anyone.",bro tereko yaad hai suring iyer transfer to chennai \n\nyeh mf jethalal usher rajnikant electronics kholne ka soch raha tha in his dreams \n\nbhai wo aadmi bawala g@nd hai wo itna pagal hai uske peeche \n\nmehta always help him but he dont even give him any gift and gesture \n\nbut that ugly mf jethalal went to buy land on moon for that slut \n\njethalal is like friends with benifits \n\nasshole dilip joshi is annoying as hell

"I have watched this arc more than 50 times, still laugh on this scene .",Which episode is this?
"Oyeee, Navi Mumbai ka Sangeet Samraat",Oh sawariya oye hoye 😂😂
This was the funniest episode of tmkoc history,That would be the water tanker one for me
"Who else remembers this epic scene\n\nBhide : Aake sidhi lagi dil pe jese katariya, O savariya.. oy hoyy,\n\nChampak : Oyeee navi mumbai k sangeet samrat😡\n\n😂 😂 😂",Which episode is this from ?
Jethalal kuch jyada hi discount de deta h.islye Say no to gada electronics 🤣,"""Agr unko humse rishta nahi rakhna hai to hamari trf se bhi koi jabar-jasti nahi hai"""

Buy offline! What's that & proceeds saying I don't buy online 🥲,Bhai mujhe gada se maaro 🤦‍♂️ ye bewakoofi koi kaise seh sakta hai.
"After applying 4000 iq, I think what she meant w the second tweet is that she doesn't buy online and that's why she's asking whether amazon is good or not. Her sentence formation structure is too fucked up, that's the whole point",But she specifically asked “sorry what’s that?”
How much bimbo you can be? \n\nMunmun Dutta: yes !!!,“ How much bimbo”  waah bhai you’re no less
Itna attitude kis Baat ka hai?,"I don't think its attitude, maybe she's actually dumb."
I’ve seen her at a mall yelling on top of her voice to a fan who followed her to take a selfie dont know who was rite or wrong but she’s a turn off when she opens her mouth,"If someone followed me, I would also be pissed."
"Bro, I had seen her Twitter long time back and her Twitter is full of anti Muslim content. Like 99% of her tweets are anti Muslim.",Really? Didn't know that... Ohhh goddd.. and she is much of a racist person too irl it seems ...
Can't even take a joke 😂,"As per my knowledge, her insta comments are filled with Jetha-Babita (Boobita) comments. So she might have gotten frustrated."

Ek taraf kehti hai ki ""mai teri girlfriend ban jau? "" Aur dusre pal"" tu kisi pe line kyo nhi marta kya pata koi pat jaaye "" Ab maine ghar change kiya tha socha finally ab baat nhi hogi ab bhul jaunga. Par bc fir se pata nhi kaise mera number dundh ke fir se phone kar diya aur wahi cheesy and flirty lines. Kya karu kuch samajh nhi aata. Ab toh maine usse as more than friend and less than girlfriend maan liya hai ab jaise woh baate karti hai waise hi karta hu agar woh flirt karegi toh mai bhi wahi karunga aur agar woh as a friend baat karegi toh fir mai bhi."

"Chutiye ho bhai tum log. Mai sahi bta rha. Chutiya katwana koi tumse seekhe. Agar revenue reduce hua hai to spending bhi reduce hogi. Corporate tax laws, employment laws aur labor laws mein loda koi change nhi aa rha, instead ye chutiyaap ho rha hai. \n\nLet me explain once, if you earned 17.15LPA in the earlier tax slabs, you get 12LPA in after deducting income tax of 30%. Now any company paying there employees in the range of 12LPA to 17.15LPA cut costs by directly paying them 12LPA  or even less, as a person receiving 12LPA makes 8.4LPA after deduction of 30% income tax.\n\n\n For example, if i used to 13 LPA, after tax, I got 9.1 lakhs. Now the company decides to give me a raise, and reduced the number to 10LPA. What would that do? It gives me 10LPA and gives the company a benefit of paying 10 instead of 13. \n\nThese laws allow more benefit to the corporates than the employees. Just like every other law and scheme made by this government.",I didn't get it. 🥲

As if in korea an Indian wouldn't get stared at. I'm glad she apologized.,Only because he knew Korean too
Nah but she clearly wouldn’t have apologized if he didn’t started speaking in Korean. Korean people have so much superiority complex and view Indians with such hatred unless someone is pretty/fair. But yeah glad she did the bare minimum.,"Even our 3rd world comrades from Nepal & Sri Lanka look down us. Western liberals go full Nazi when talking about Indians. Western right wing blurts out Eugenics & they are the ones who invented words like Pajeet, Poo in the loo, designated shitting street for India. \n\nOnly the people who are separated from internet might have some respect for India."

Is this used to intercept incoming missiles?,"1. Detection:\n\nThe radar system (like 91N6E Big Bird) constantly scans the airspace.\n\nIt can detect aircraft, stealth fighters, drones, or missiles up to 600 km away.\n\n\n\n2. Tracking:\n\nOnce a target is spotted, tracking radars (like 92N6E) lock onto the target.\n\nThe system can track dozens of targets at once.\n\n\n\n3. Threat Evaluation:\n\nThe system analyzes the threat—is it a fighter jet, a cruise missile, or a decoy?\n\nThe command center decides which targets to engage, and in what order.\n\n\n\n4. Engagement:\n\nThe S-400 selects the appropriate missile based on range and target type.\n\nFor nearby jets: 9M96 missile\n\nFor long-range bombers or AWACS: 48N6 or 40N6 missile\n\n\nA missile is launched vertically, then adjusts mid-air toward the target.\n\n\n\n5. Guidance:\n\nThe missile is guided by radar and can correct its path in real-time.\n\nSome versions have active seekers to lock onto targets themselves in the final phase.\n\n\n\n6. Destruction:\n\nThe missile closes in and explodes near the target, destroying it with shrapnel or a direct hit"
Yoo hello from Pakistan🇵🇰 i you need any news ask me cz ur media is shit,You need to take English lessons first

3L tax right?,"Accuracy chhodo, Emotions dekho"
"Ok, here is the modified part :-\n\nBoy 12L + Girl 6L -> No Tax\n\nBoy 18L + Girl 0   -> Tax\n\nBoth households are bringing the same amount of income, yet taxed differently.","unhe triple chaiyea bro ,  double mein bhi nahi chalega"
"these financial influencers are getting out of hand. bhai, tax collection per person basis pe hota hai, per couple ya household basis pe nhin.",But why? Shouldn’t a household be taxed as one? So the woman not earning anything is not using any resources that the govt provides at the same level that her husband is using?
dude my mom earns the same as my dad 😭 you aren't speaking for everyone,Did she earn the same when they married though? Then that's very rare.
"Marriage is a sham for boys, you just become an ATM machine for the bride's family.","No, you become a cash cow. ATMs don’t dispense other people’s money."
"In second case, divert your income towards your non earning family members.",sending my 5 year old to interview in company I work in
Girl earning 70k per month will look for a man earning atleast 2lakh per month.. at least. Even the honest good hearted ones will think this. The toxic evil ones will toh think something even higher n unimaginable.,Bhai sahab. Kaha se kamaye itna.
"Why can't there ever be a post such as working woman, house husband?","Because barely any woman would marry a guy who is earning equal to her , let alone being a house husband. There might be few , but most consider wealth as a primary concern for marriage ."
As someone who’s earning well and in AM market lately. I disagree. Not every girl is looking for hypergamy. I know women who married guys who were earning less than them. Majority of the guys I’ve came across are earning less than me and that’s fine with me.,We will see about that some years later.  Pretty sure you would have been married to someone who is atleast 2 times richer than you
You all are surrounded by really shallow and materialistic women,"Materialism is something that every woman wants,just like every man wants a beautiful woman (decently atleast)"
Yeah I mean dahej me agar 3-4 cr de rahi hai to roi to accha maange gi hi na. Stupid to think ki anyone will marry incel for love.,Do you know what incel means?
Yall should stop being terminally online and talk to people in the real world,"If you took your own advice, you’d realise how correct that post is."
My cousin Mami earns more than my mama and an aunty in my colony also earns more than her husband too. So yeahh it's not 100 per true. Oh and my taeji also earns more.,The society has become shallow in itself.\nThey just enjoy mocking others on whatever aspect they can. Ground reality me still kuch log achche Hain and they should not get demean.

"Our college was feeling so generous (on the sincere occasion of NAAC stepping foot on the premises) that they decided to shower students with ""awards"" mid curriculum. For last five years we haven't received shit. Behold the power of NAAC.","My university deserves lowest NAAC rating. Exams delayed by 6 months, results not on time, 80% get failed in same subject with exactly same marks for every student. In short we all decided to give worst rating possible on NAAC survey.\n\nTo our surprise our university recieved A grade in NAAC survey and it's only one in our state to achieve this. For context my university is last choice for any student. \n\nReason for high rating - due to some so called technical issue, NAAC team wisited our university for 2nd time and our rating magically improved - from lowest to highest."

"The fuck did i read •́  ‿ ,•̀","It's been one year, you must remember this masterpiece.\n\n\nHi I am a guy from New Delhi. Actually my girlfriend used to get intense cramps during her periods. When I used to go down on her, I could smell her blood and its fragrance oof, best in the world. I wanted that kinda blood too so I decided to get artificial periods. I used to beat my gf with a stick (BDSM roleplay) and collect her blood as and when she started bleeding. Then I'd pour all of it in a polythene and stick it inside my asshole. Whenever I went to poop, the polythene used to come out and all the blood would just gush outta my tiny asshole.

This made me think \nIs there maid porn?,Yes there is. Plenty of it infact
"Some years ago, I was struck by the contrast between the beauty of Hindi film heroines and the ugliness of Hindi film heroes. After researching the matter, I concluded that the explanation was straightforward: leading men in Hindi films were ugly because they were Indian men, and Indian men were measurably uglier than Indian women. You don’t have to take my word for it: cursory surveys of marriages, morchas, classrooms, offices and homes will bear out this observation.\n\nWhile my observation was accurate and the data I had gathered reliable, I made the mistake of attributing the ugliness of the Indian male to nature. I know now that Indian men aren’t born ugly: they achieve ugliness through practice. It is their habits and routines that make them ugly. If I was to be schematic, I’d argue that Indian men are ugly on account of the three Hs: hygiene, hair and horrible habits.\n\nLet’s start with their extremities. Examine the nails of any Indian man: the cuticles will be yellow with haldi and the underside of the bitten-off tip will be spotty with accumulated dirt. When you think of where they put those nails, this is not surprising. I’ve seen respectable men conducting conversations with their index fingers two-digits deep in their nostrils, digging with industrial enthusiasm. If you ever see a desi man delicately rubbing the tip of his index finger over the pad of his thumb, beware. Don’t go near him: he’s rolling the bogies he’s mined into little balls.\n\nHe uses those same fingers to adjust himself in public. All Indian men do this, without exception. The refined ones do it furtively, but the majority do it openly without shame or embarrassment. A famous Indian batsman does this regularly with the butt end of his bat handle under the gaze of thousands of spectators. You can’t do this and be good-looking, you really can’t. You could be John Abraham (an exception to our ugly rule) and your looks wouldn’t survive this particular habit. And if it isn’t the thumb and forefinger, it’s the pinkie inserted into the ear and vibrated with manic vigour. This generally comes with eye-rolling and little oinks of pleasure. You’ll never see women doing this, only men. It’s an important route to ugliness.\n\nThe sounds they make are crucial to the unattractiveness of Indian men. For example, an Indian man with a cold will, in company, try to snort up the congestion and swallow it. He’ll do it over and over again, completely unaware of the revulsion it causes. When he eats, there’s another repertoire of sounds born of the fact that sub-continental men don’t keep their lips together while chewing. If you think this doesn’t apply to you because you do keep your mouth shut while processing food, you’re wrong. A second before swallowing, you part your lips and swipe your tongue over your palate, to juice the last taste out of the morsel, and you make a sucking noise. If you want to test this out, use grapes: they generate the slurpiest sounds.\n\nBut hair habits do even more to intensify the ugliness of Indian men than the sounds they involuntarily make. Statistically, some ninety per cent of all south Asian men wear moustaches, their masculinity seems to be critically dependent on this growth. I don’t mean the beard-cum-moustaches style which is respectable, but the standalone moustache. Even here, a bushy, Zapata-style moustache has something going for it, but the styles Indian men favour are a) the twirled moustache and b) the little trimmed one. The first makes its host ridiculous, the second makes him look like a harried clerk or, if the hair has been trimmed into a thin line, like a sexual predator.\n\nMiddle-aged men improve on this by dyeing their hair a radiant black then letting their roots show. Or, like General Musharraf, they will dye the hair on top of their heads but leave their side-burns grey because they think they’ve read somewhere that this makes them look distinguished. It doesn’t: it makes them look like unreliable car-dealers.\n\nIndian men wear badly because they look into magic mirrors that hide the changes middle-age brings. For example, they don’t notice the hair growing out of their nostrils in little tufts and, consequently, don’t trim it. Even worse, the hair bristling out of their ears in great wiry jets is invisible to them because their narcissism is so complete, so proofed against reality, that what they see in the mirror is not their reflection but a favourite photograph taken twenty years and twenty kilos ago.\n\nBut speaking for myself, the oddest aspect of the Indian man is the things he’s willing to wear, and I’m not talking about his dress sense because that would need a book. I’m talking, for example, about the thick bands of rotting pink threads that north Indian men wear around their wrists. I’m sure there’s some respectable ritual reason for this that requires them to keep these threads on till they discolour and fall off, but why would you change your clothes every day if you’re willing to wear something that you sweat into for weeks?\n\nThen there’s their keenness on necklaces. Not one, but as many as they can wear. Not content with doing this, they leave the top buttons of their shirts unbuttoned so you can see that tangled jumble of amulets and gold chains and lockets. Sreesanth and Ganguly wear so many that they look like shady trinket vendors.\n\nAny inventory of the ways in which Indian men achieve ugliness has to include their relationship with rings. We’re not talking about nice rings, say a discreet wedding band, but cheap rings with coloured stones in tarnished silver settings worn on every finger of both hands, not excluding thumbs. Since the average Indian man’s fingers aren’t long and slender, the net effect is one of sausages banded with metal.\n\nWhy are Indian men like this? How do they achieve the bullet-proof unselfconsciousness that allows them to be so abandonedly ugly? I think it comes from a sense of entitlement that’s hard-wired into every male child that grows up in an Indian household. That, and the not unimportant fact that, despite the way they look, they’re always paired off with good-looking women.","Nah, man, it's not just their habits and manners. They are born ugly. Most of them don't have good features, which is such a shame. And please it's never the skin color that makes them ugly. It's the ugly ass features and lack of facial harmony. Do go cry to your parents about this.\n\nMix this with their ugly dressing sense, generic haircut, tacky beard shape, lack of hygiene, and really strong body odour - a concoction of ugliness. \nOn top of this, their audacity to just exist, not groom themselves, judge women for doing the same. It's the lack of awareness that makes them ugly."
"Short answer is vegetarian diet and excessive marriage within communities (same community same religion same caste same sub caste) for generations which causes inbreeding to an extent, You have to mate with someone from a very different gene pool for genes to pass down well. Now about women, big eyes with heavy scleral show and a weak jawline are not unattractive features on women but they are unattractive on men. This is made worse by the presence of a beard with some dudes have a very feminine eye area with a beard slapped on the face, creating the face of a man who looks like a woman with a beard.",This is a logical response. Very well thought out
"As a gay man, Indian (and Asian come in second) men turn me completely off.",Why Asian? Asian men are hot and they’re clean.
"As an Indian man born and raised in the States, I’ve noticed the stigma behind Indian men and their looks. Just so y’all know, India is a third world country, so they don’t spend a lot of time or money about their looks. They care more about their children, getting food on the table, paying bills, work, etc. American culture is so wrapped around people looking “beautiful” or “handsome” but don’t realize that some people just don’t care about being attractive. I care about my looks and I’m lucky to have the resources to make myself look more attractive. However if I didn’t, I know I would be way uglier. And so would you if you were payed an average Indian salary. Let’s just be kind and not make fun of people, it’s free.","India is considered a developing/middle income country. Many Latin American countries share this distinction and yet do not have the same reputation of being unattractive as India does. In fact, many such countries like Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, etc are known all over the world for their attractive men and women. Even an impoverished country like Venezuela is known for having very beautiful women. Being a Latino myself, I have first hand experience in knowing that despite our often poor socioeconomic standing, most Latinos and especially women, take great pride in their appearance. So you see, it’s not an issue of the poor not having the means to look good or the rich being too hyper focused on appearance. It’s the standard of physical attractiveness that’s lacking in India compared to the rest of the world."
"Wow as an Indian woman, this sub has no clue the generalisation they are making. A lot of Indian men just come from poor background and are busy just surviving instead of staring constantly in the mirror. Men from upper middle class do take better care of themselves. And I find there is ugly and beautiful people in every race. Physical beauty fades over time and it's your partner's heart that you learn to see. Western media is so focused on physical features that they lose themselves. Most Western women themselves fall prey to this and start getting surgeries. I am dating an Indian man and he is the love of my life. He is physically a very beautiful man and his heart is even more beautiful. I cant believe that if I was born in the west, I might have been mind-washed like this to hate on people on the basis of their ethnicity. Get out of your screen and touch some grass. Indian people are beautiful and it makes no difference to us if you believe that they are not beautiful, someone else surely will see their heart . <3","Yeah except for the fact that if physically you gross me out, i aint going to do anything with you and i certainly aint going to let you kiss me. Lots of men gross me out from all races. Its mostly the men who are unhygienic, have terrible hairstyles, have freakishly large ears or noses, and if their eyes are too close or too far apart. Most men from any race and fix that thou with being more hygenic or having a hairstyle that fits their face. Most of the time, its just a hairstyle change that is needed. You may be able to overlook all of... that. But i would absolutely be sick over it. Its like your ugly dirty ass uncle trying to kiss you, its such an ick. Id rather be unalive than be forced to be with a man who grossed me out so much that i dont want to even touch him. You probably wont read down here but just so you know, my brothers are pretty good looking. The younger one needs a better hair cut and the older one needs to stop cutting his hair too short because it makes him look weird. But if either of them smell bad or look dirty, i dont want to even be in the same space as them, i quite literally will hold my breath. I dont even want them to brush past me either at that point. If they are clean, I'd gladly give them a hug. Its mostly about taking care of yourself."
"Hi . So , um, you’re not completely right but you’re not completely wrong either . Mind you , those aren’t cheap rings , they’re rhine/birthstone rings which are very expensive . They’re meant to keep the evil eye away and for other things . \nI’m a gen z girl and I feel that with the onset of social media and globalisation , a lot of boys , at least from my generation are def keeping up with their looks and latest trends . There are still many others who don’t and that’s where the concept of arranged marriage comes . U see here in India , a lot of people still have their marriages arranged by their families. While look is a factor , it’s not the most important factor that u look for in a groom . It’s his job , prospects and family that we look into first and then looks . \nSo I think that could be a reason why boys don’t really take care but nowadays they do though . A lot is changing here these days and things are looking good . At least from where I come from . 😇",I just don’t understand how you can vow to live with someone you don’t find attractive for the rest of your life.
